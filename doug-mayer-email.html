<h1>Some Thoughts on "The Hike From Hell"<br />by<br />Doug Mayer</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>Doug Mayer was kind enough to send me an email with some thoughts
on the various hiking adventures he and his friends had, and has
allowed me to reproduce it.</p>

<p>Anyway, some miscellaneous thoughts about our two 4,000 footer hikes,
in no particular order:</p>

<p>We did know about the Fitches before our first hike. Guy and Laura had
recounted their story to me&mdash;it really inspired me, too. That sort of
fun, silly adventure in the mountains among friends was pretty much
exactly what I had in mind. Unfortunately, the only friends I had were
Al and Bill, so I had to settle for them. (Guys, I'm joking, I'm
joking.)</p>

<p>The choice of 8 days seemed to be the most comfortable number of days
that appeared doable for us. I do remember thinking we might have done
it in 7 (and two years ago we mulled that over, partway through the
trip if I remember right??), but that seemed too much for us&mdash;if we
were going to have fun, be able to joke about it when we were hiking
and actually get a good night's sleep. The Fitch list, of course, is
slightly different than the current list, if anyone pays attention to
those things. (What am I saying... I know others do. I don't have a
brain that works to keep track of lists very well.)</p>

<p>It was interesting to see your elevation totals. That surprised
me. It might also explain why Parlett's feet swelled up so much
. (Bill, seen any studies on rapid decompression of the pedal
extremities during hiking, due to changes in altitude?)</p>

<p>You asked about training. Eating Ben and Jerry's, running in to visit
the RMC trail crew and hiking to Gray Knob for dinner were my three
components. Bill took the opposite approach, and seems to generally
choose to sit at his desk and rest for months in advance&mdash;and after,
our hikes. Not sure about Al, though I don't think he's human,
anyway. Seriously, I did nothing special. Just a bunch of
hiking. Living in Randolph and supervising the RMC trail crews makes
that almost mandatory...</p>

<p>Personally, I'm glad we didn't break the Fitch record, since that's
how the hike would have been defined by others, I suspect. For me, the
memories will always been about the long, fun days cruising through
the Whites with my friends, and all the great anecdotes that were
created. Some day, years from now, Bill, Al and I will no doubt be
sitting in the Coos County old folk's home in Berlin, and be telling
these stories, while nurses try to analyze why we have no cartilage
left in our knees.</p>

<p>So, those are my rambling thought on the topic. The folks cranking
through the list in 3 or 4 days are, obviously, in a totally different
league from us slackers. All I know is we had a blast, and I hope
they're having just as much fun! (Who knows, maybe I can rally Bill
and Al again to do it in a few more years. Bill says I have to see how
much it hurts when I'm over 40...) I do like to do long hikes every
summer&mdash;Mahoosucs in a day, Huts Traverses, etc., so I still do a bit
of that every year, or try to.</p>

<p>Okay, back to work. Hope that's at least somewhat useful or
insightful&mdash;though I'm hardly every accused of being either!</p>
