<h1>The Hike From Hell<br />New Hampshire Fours in Eight Days</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">


<p>In the summer of 1991 Al Sochard, Bill Parlette and Doug Mayer did
the 48 New Hampshire 4,000 footers in eight days.  Doug Mayer was kind
enough to send me an old email that he had sent to some of his hiking
friends before starting the second (2001) round of the 48 Fours in
eight days. It includes the 1991 itinerary, and also shows the spirit
of fun in which they approached the endeavor. I have made a table
showing my estimates of the <a href="eight-day-table.html">daily
mileages and elevation gains</a>, and added my comments on this
achievement there.</p>

<p>Hike from Hell: The Reunion Tour</p>

<p>Dear Dubious Associates of Al, Bill and Doug,</p>

<p>It's been 10 years since our fabled Hike From Hell. Which, it
turns out, is exactly the amount of time required for the memory of
burning knee cartilage, toxic wool socks, and late nights spent
stumbling off of North Twin, Jackson and countless other peaks, to
fade from memory.</p>

<p>Which is why it's time for us to do it again.</p>

<p>And, this time, we intend to fully savor the agony&mdash;so as
to fully imprint the experience, and thereby avoid a third Hike
from Hell.</p>

<p>We hope you can partake in a little bit of our fun (we use that
word in the loosest of senses), either as a driver, day hiker,
masseuse or, if need be, a marksman to put us out of our misery.
(We are also looking for Winnebago or large van... if you don't
mind getting back a vehicle that will need to be fumigated or,
possibly, incinerated.) Bill, meanwhile, will be looking for
donated illicit painkillers, Doug for spare titanium hardware for
his leg, and Al, for a girlfriend somewhere on the trail.</p>

<p>Seriously, we would love able bodied hikers joining us for a day
of hiking, but would like only 1 or 2 folks at the most per
section. Please sign up early, and send a completed registration
form and a cashiers check (Tirey this means you&mdash;we're still
trying to collect for that bogus check you sent us last time) for
$500, to help defray our inevitable early-admittance nursing home
costs.</p>

<p>This time around, we have the Internet&mdash;and you can follow
our progress via a bulletin board we've set up, at ... (obviously
long gone).</p>

<p>We'll post the grim details there. Add your e mail to the list,
and you'll be sure to get some sordid tales each night, for 8
days.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the previous 4,000 footers have eroded
enough to make the list any easier. It's the same route as last
time... Specifically:</p>
