<h3>The 4,000-Footers of the White Mountains. A Guide and History.
By Steven D. Smith and Mike Dickerman. Bondcliff Books. 2001.
$19.95.</h3>

<p>This book, by two prolific White Mountain authors with extensive
hiking experience, is the first to be devoted exclusively to the
Four Thousand Footers. As such it will be of obvious interest to
peak baggers, but also to all those who frequently hike among the
higher peaks.</p>

<p>For each mountain there is an extensive description of the
physical features (ridges, spurs, streams, ravines etc), a brief
note on nomenclature, then a section on historical highlights
arranged as a timeline. This is followed by a careful description
of all the common approaches, with very useful comments to help
select the best one for the reader's needs. This is followed by
brief notes on the selection of a winter route, a very useful
feature since optimal winter routes often differ from the summer
ones. Finally there is a very good description of what can be seen
from the summit.</p>

<p>I found the description of routes very interesting, as the
authors describe many routes that few people think of using. How
many people have approached Carter Dome or the Wildcats from the
South from Carter Notch Road? This book will certainly encourage me
to try trails that I had never thought of using.</p>

<p>The sections on winter routes are, as far as I know, unique.
Authors of books on hiking in the Whites seem to ignore winter
hikers almost completely (an exception is Steve Smith's recent book
<i>Snowshoe Hikes in the White Mountains</i>, though much of it
deals with easier trips).</p>

<p>I also found the the long historic notes sections very
interesting, again this information is almost non-existent in other
hiking books.</p>

<p>This is adapted from an article I wrote for the September 2001
issue of the <i>Charles River Mud</i>, the newsletter of the Boston
Chapter of the AMC. I thank the Editor of the Mud and the Chair of
the Boston Chapter for permission to use it here.</p>
