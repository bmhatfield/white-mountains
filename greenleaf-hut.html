Greenleaf Hut (elevation 4,200 feet) is situated just above
treeline on the west slopes of Mount Lafayette, with great views of
both Franconia and Kinsman ridges. It is possible to do a leisurely
ascent to the hut on one day, and to climb to the summit of Mount
Lafayette and return to the car the next. It can also be used to
break the rather strenuous loop over Little Haystack and Mounts
Lincoln and Lafayette into two easier days, or as the start (or
end) of a traverse of the northern rim of the Pemigewasset
Wilderness. 

<p>The AMC web site has a page on the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-greenleaf.cfm">Greenleaf Hut</a>, with information on the hut,
season of operation and rates.  Here I give hiking information that
supplements what they offer, describing the most frequently used
access routes (with distances, elevation gains and <a
href="faq1.html#booktime1">book time</a>), and <i>some</i> of the
trips that can utilize the hut, including hut to hut trips.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Getting to Greenleaf Hut and
Back</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Old Bridle Path</h3>

<p>The shorter common route to Greenleaf Hut starts from Lafayette
Place, and rises gradually most of the way (ow: 2.9 miles; 2,450
feet; 2:40). The trail starts gently through beautiful open
hardwoods. About half way to the hut there are excellent views down
into Walker Ravine and up to the ridge. Shortly after that there
are a few steep pitches, called "the Agonies" by the hut Croo. Then
the grade becomes gentler, and the hut is reached just above
treeline. Returning from the hut this is "downhill all the way"
(ow: 2.9 miles; 0 feet; 1:25).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Falling Waters, Franconia
Ridge and Greenleaf Trails</h3>

<p>This is the longer way, which combines the scenic waterfalls
along the Falling Waters Trail with the spectacular views on the
Franconia Ridge and Greenleaf trails (ow: 5.9 miles; 3,850 feet;
4:50). The Falling Waters Trail starts out with the Old Bridle
Path, and soon diverges from it, crossing Walker Brook on a bridge.
The trail soon crosses Dry Brook (which can be difficult at high
water) and follows it, then one of its branches up, crossing both
several times. There are many waterfalls along the trail, hence the
name. After the last brook crossing the trail rises steeply to the
summit of Little Haystack. From here to the hut it is above
treeline, exposed to the weather.</p>

<p>This trail is often used to return to the road by those who have
reached the hut by the Old Bridle Path, it has two climbs, from the
hut to the summit of Mount Lafayette, and from the col to the
summit of Mount Lincoln (ow: 5.9 miles; 1,350 feet; 3:40).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Greenleaf Trail</h3>

<p>This trail is used much less often than the other two (ow: 2.7
miles; 2,250 feet; 2:25). It starts from the Cannon mountain
Tramway parking lot and, after crossing under the highway, ascends
gently to the wild Eagle Pass. From there it rises more steeply to
the hut. There are no distant views, the only interesting feature
being Eagle Pass. The return trip is also purely downhill (ow: 2.7
miles; 0 feet; 1:20).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Hikes From Greenleaf
Hut</h2>

<p>The only real hike possible from Greenleaf Hut is to the summit
of Mount Lafayette and back (rt: 2.2 miles; 1,050 feet; 1:40).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Routes to Neighboring
Huts</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Routes to Lonesome Lake
Hut</h3>

<p>The short way of going from Greenleaf Hut to
<a href="lonesome-lake-hut.html">Lonesome Lake Hut</a> is to
descend to Lafayette Place by the Old Bridle Path, then take the
Lonesome Lake and Cascade Brook trails to Lonesome Lake Hut (ow:
4.5 miles; 950 feet; 2:45).</p>

<p>The longer scenic route is to begin by ascending to the summit
of Mount Lafayette, then take the Franconia Ridge Trail to Little
Haystack, and descend to Lafayette Place by the Falling Waters
Trail. From there take the Lonesome Lake and Cascade Brook trails
to Lonesome Lake Hut (ow: 7.5 miles; 2,400 feet; 5:00).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Routes to Galehead Hut</h3>

<p>There is only one way of going from Greenleaf Hut to
<a href="galehead-hut.html">Galehead Hut</a>. Take the Greenleaf
Trail to the summit of Mount Lafayette, then follow the ups and
downs of the Garfield Ridge Trail, over Mount Garfield (and many
smaller bumps) to Galehead Hut (ow: 7.7 miles; 2,950 feet; 5:20).
The Garfield Ridge Trail is notorious for being steep and rocky,
and more difficult than the numbers might indicate.</p>
