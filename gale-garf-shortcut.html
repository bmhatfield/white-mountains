<h1>Shortcut Between Garfield Trail and Gale River Trailhead</h1>

<div id="main">


<p>Hikers planning on climbing both Galehead Mountain and Mount
Garfield on the same trip with only one car usually walk from one
trailhead to the other. There is, however, a slightly shorter, and in
my opinion more interesting, alternative.</p>

<p>There is a logging road (at one time it was maintained as a
snowmobile trail) that crosses the Garfield Trail between the upper
and middle stream crossings. It is familiar to some as a way of
avoiding the stream crossings at high water.  It heads more or less
east, going over a bridge used in the bypass, and is in reasonably
good condition. After a few tenths of a mile the road suddenly becomes
very overgrown, but at this point a newer road goes uphill (south) a
short distance to a clearing. A very good logging road goes east from
that clearing. On reaching a second clearing (which it does not enter)
it makes a right angle turn and goes north, meeting the Gale River
Road at a gate (a useful landmark if doing this in reverse), which can
be followed to the Gale River trailhead. It probably saves about half
a mile or so of distance, and greatly shortens the road walk.

<p>The map below shows relevant sections
the Garfield and Gale river trails (dashed red lines), the Gale River
Road (heavy black line), the recommended logging road (medium black
line) and the old, very overgrown, logging road (dashed black
line).</p>
