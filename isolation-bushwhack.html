<h1>Winter Bushwhack Route to Mount Isolation, NH<br />by<br />Peakbagger</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">


<p>Isolation from the Rt 16 parking lot for Rocky Branch. This
route save a few miles and lots of elevation. I have attempted it
three times in the winter and was succesful twice. This is not
something I would do alone and the one time I was not successful
was with one other person and we basically got slowed down breaking
trail. It will cut at least 2 to three hours off a trip to
Isolation in the winter. I make no warranties of the suitability of
the trip in non snow conditions as the undergrowth may be nasty
(then again it may not). Its a much sunnier route than taking the
trails and we usually get sunburned.</p>

<p>First buy a copy of the Stairs Mountain 7.5 minute quad. Now
park at the rocky branch parking lot early in the morning and head
west until you encounter the small pass that is roughly between the
Engine Hill label and the wilderness boundary crossing. In the
field, it is quite obvious that you have gone up and over a flat
col on the trail. Very soon after the col, after you have dropped
in elevation slightly you should encounter a fairly straight
section of trail lined with fairly thick softwoods on your right.
Check your altimeter if you have one and take a compass bearing
roughly along the 3080 contour line (actually go just a bit west of
the contour line. What you are shooting for is where the 3200 foot
contour line intersects the rocky branch trail. Now cut through the
band of softwoods and come out in a series of open birch glades.
Stay on your bearing and make sure you dont drop down off of the
contour. You will get frequent views of Isolation off to the west.
Keep an eye on it. You are trying to come out on the rocky branch
trail when it is ust slightly south of a westerly bearing. If in
doubt, slab slightly uphill. Dependent upon snow conditions, you
should hit a fairly thick softwood stand in about 30 to 60 minutes,
and you shoudl hear the rocky branch stream. The rocky branch trail
is cut through softwoods in this area and looks like an old road
cut through the woods. If you have an altimeter use the trail to go
north or south to around 3200 feet.</p>

<p>Now find a spot to view Isolation if you can. Take a new bearing
that will get you to the col between Isolation and the unnamed peak
north of Isolation (the dry range wilderness boundary runs throguh
this col). Now carefully cross the rocky branch and try to stay up
out of the drainage valley on its north side. What you sould try is
to slab west slowly gaining elevation until you intersect the brook
draining at the inersection of the 3400 foot contour. Now folow the
brook up through the softwoods. It can get kind of dense and the
snow can get deep, but its not a real long section. Stay witin
sight of the brook as the going is bad on either side of it. When
you reach the top of the ridge, you will enconter the Davis path.
Follow it south until you reach the cutoff to the Isolations
summit.</p>

<p>Now the fun part, turn around and run back to the car. The
majority of the trip out is well graded and can be done fairly
quickly. The one caveat is that on real warm winter (or early
spring days, the sun can make the snow stickly and wet.</p>

<p>Have fun.</p>
