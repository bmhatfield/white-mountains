Madison Spring Hut, situated in the col between Mount Madison and
Mount Adams at an elevation of 4,800 feet, was the first structure
built by the AMC in 1888. It burned in October 1940 and was
immediately rebuilt, being reopened in August 1941. 

<p>Its location is spectacular, but visitors have to earn the views
they get! While Lakes of the Clouds Hut is at a higher elevation,
and Galehead Hut is farther from a road, Madison Hut requires the
most vertical ascent from the trailhead (about 3,500 feet by most
routes).</p>

<p>It can be used for a relatively easy two day ascent of Mounts
Madison and Adams, or as the start (or end) of a three day (two
night) hut based Presidential Traverse.</p>

<p>The AMC web site has a page on the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-madison.cfm">Madison Hut</a>, with information on the hut,
season of operation and rates.  Here I give hiking information that
supplements what they offer, describing the most frequently used
access routes (with distances, elevation gains and <a
href="faq1.html#booktime1">book time</a>), and <i>some</i> of the
trips that can utilize the hut, including hut to hut trips.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Getting to Madison Hut and
Back</h2>

<p>I am assuming that most people will want to get to the hut with
minimal effort on the first day, and leave Mount Adams for the
second day. The easiest way of climbing both mountains on a two day
trip is to go up the Valley Way to the hut and, after resting a bit
and lightening one's pack, climb Mount Madison. On the second day
follow the Gulfside Trail to the Airline, and take that trail to
the summit of Mount Adams. Then return to the trailhead by taking
the Airline Trail all the way down.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Valley Way Trail</h3>

<p>This is the easiest way of getting to the hut (ow: 3.8 miles;
3,550 feet; 3:40). The grades are easier than on most of the other
trails, and the footing is better. It is in the trees with no views
until the hut, but since the hut and adjoining summits have such
great views that is no great loss.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Watson Path</h3>

<p>The Watson Path leaves the Valley Way about two thirds of the
way up to the hut, and goes over the summit of Mount Madison.
Hikers then must descend to the hut using the Osgood Trail (ow: 4.6
miles; 4,050 feet; 4:20). It is both steeper and rougher than the
Valley Way, and does not give the opportunity of resting at the hut
before climbing Mount Madison.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Airline Trail and Airline
Cutoff</h3>

<p>This trail starts at Appalachia with the Valley Way, and very
shortly diverges to the right. It is steeper in parts than the
Valley Way, and also somewhat rougher. It reaches treeline at a
lower elevation, and has excellent views into King's Ravine as it
goes along the crest of Durant Ridge. The Airline Cutoff connects
the Airline Trail to the hut, it is completely sheltered by the
scrub (ow: 3.7 miles; 3,550 feet; 3:40).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Gulfside and Airline Trails
Over Mount Adams</h3>

<p>This route is more suitable for descent than for ascent (ow: 5.2
miles; 950 feet; 3:05). From the hut follow the Gulfside Trail to
its junction with the Airline Trail, then take the Airline Trail to
the summit of Mount Adams. Return to the trailhead by the Airline
Trail.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Osgood Trail</h3>

<p>The Osgood Trail can be used to reach Madison Hut from two
starting points. One can start at the Great Gulf trailhead and
follow the Great Gulf and Osgood Trails to the summit and then down
to the hut (5.6 miles; 4,050 feet; 4:50) or one can follow the AT
from Pinkham Notch Visitor Center along the Old Jackson Road,
Madison Gulf, Great Gulf, Osgood Cutoff and Osgood Trails to the
hut (7.7 miles; 4,050 feet; 5:50).</p>

<p>The Osgood Trail is very exposed to the weather in its upper
part. It is possible to bypass the summit of Mount Madison by
taking the Parapet Trail, which runs on the south side of the
mountain, somewhat protected from the prevailing northwest winds.
It is a very rough trail, and should only be used to avoid the
weather; it is less strenuous to go over the summit than around
it!</p>

<h2><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Hikes From Madison Hut</h2>

<p>Most visitors to the hut will want to explore the area around
the hut, specially Star Lake and the parapet (about 0.7 miles and
100 feet, 0:20).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Mount Madison</h3>

<p>The Osgood Trail reaches the summit of Mount Madison in an easy
half mile (each way) with 550 vertical feet from the hut, for a
book time of 0:45. There are 360&deg; views, I specially enjoy the
view into the Great Gulf.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Mount Adams</h3>

<p>The standard way of reaching Mount Adams from the hut is by
following the Gulfside Trail to its junction with the Airline
Trail, and taking the latter to the summit (rt: 1.8 miles; 950
feet; 1:20). While there is some scrambling this is probably the
easiest way up Mount Adams.</p>

<p>A more "sporting" ascent can be made by following the Star Lake
Trail, which ascends the steep and rough southwest side of Mount
John Quincy Adams on its way to the main summit (rt: 2.0 miles;
1,000 feet; 1:30).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>Routes to Neighboring
Huts</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Routes to Lakes Hut</h3>

<p>The easiest route to Lakes Hut is to follow the Gulfside Trail
from the hut almost to the Cog Railway, then bypass the summit of
Mount Washington by taking the Westside Trail to its junction with
the Crawford Path. Then follow the Crawford Path to Lakes Hut (ow:
6.8 miles; 1,850 feet; 4:20).</p>

<p>This bypasses all the summits. Going over Mount Washington adds
0.7 miles and 650 feet (0:40). The loops over Mts. Clay and
Jefferson add little distance and about 300 feet each (0:10), while
going up Mt. Adams by the Airline Trail and descending by Lowe's
Path adds 0.4 miles and 300 feet (0:20). Going over all the summits
adds 1.1 miles and 1,550 feet (1:20), almost doubling the total
elevation gain.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>Routes to Carter Notch
Hut</h3>

<p>The shortest route to Carter Notch Hut is to take the Osgood and
Great Gulf Trails down to Rt. 16, walk about half a mile south on
the road, and take the Nineteen Mile Brook Trail to the hut (ow:
9.4 miles; 2,450 feet; 5:55).</p>

<p>A <i>much</i> more strenuous route is to take the AT between the
two huts, going to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, then taking the
Lost Pond Trail to the Wildcat Ridge Trail, and following the
latter over all the peaks of that ridge to Carter Notch (ow: 13.6
miles; 4,350 feet; 9:00).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref10a" id="tocref10a"></a>Routes to Pinkham Notch
Visitor Center</h3>

<p>While Pinkham Notch Visitor Center is not a hut, it can be used
to break the trip between Madison and Carter Notch huts. As noted
above, the AT goes from the hut to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center
(ow: 7.7 miles; 1,100 feet; 4:25)</p>
