<h1>The Hike From Heck<br />Vermont and Maine 4,000 Footers in Five Days</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>Two years after <a href="eight-days.html">The Hike From Hell</a>
Sue Johnston, Al Sochard, Bill Parlette, Doug Mayer and others decided
to do the remaining New England 4,000 footers in five days, a project
they dubbed "The Hike From Heck".  At the time there were only twelve
4,000 footers recognized in Maine, as maps at the time showed both
Redington and Spaulding as being below 4,000 feet.</p>

<p>On the <b>first day</b> they did all five of the Vermont Fours, taking
about 26 hours including driving time.  They split into two groups to
do Mounts Abraham and Ellen, starting from opposite ends and swapping
keys when they met.</p>

<p>Since Sue and two others have recently done the Vermont Fours in
winter in under 15 hours I asked her about the time, and she replied:
"Although I didn't write down specific times, the VT 4's in 26 hours
"door to door" sounds about right.  We weren't really hurrying, even
stopping for lunch in Waitsfield and dinner in Stowe.  (On our recent
winter VT 4's trip, Bob, Jeffrey and I were going more for
time... although it could be done faster with a crew!)"</p>

<p>After finishing the VT 4's on Mt. Mansfield, some of the group
spent the night at Sue's home in Waterford, VT; others went to Doug's
in Randolph, NH.  They met <b>next morning</b> at Welsh's Restaurant
in Gorham before tackling Old Speck (a short drive), then drove to the
Rangeley area and did Saddleback and its Horn by the ski slopes.</p>

<p>On <b>day three</b> they stayed in the area and did the two
Crockers, the Bigelows and Sugarloaf (again, by the ski slopes).  That
night (I quote Sue): "We camped out near the Sugarloaf Ski Area.
Since we set up camp in the dark, we were surprised the next morning
to find that we were in the middle of condo land!  We high-tailed it
out of there pretty quickly if I remember correctly."</p>

<p>On <b>day four</b> they finished the Rangeley-Stratton peaks with
Mount Abraham, then drove (a long way!) to Baxter State Park.  They
had no reservations (on the week of the Fourth of July) but were
allowed to stay at the Nesowadnehunk Field campground, and did North
Brother in the dark.</p>

<p>Finally, on <b>day five</b>, they did Kathadin's two peaks by the
Hunt Trail.  Sue's comment on that day: "It was a sweltering hot day
with no wind, and I think we all ran out of water.  When we got to
Katahdin Stream on the way down, some of us filled our water bottles
and drank directly from the stream, we were so thirsty!"</p>

<p>A lot of hiking and, of course, a lot of driving!  I will soon add
a table of daily distances and elevation gains.</p>
