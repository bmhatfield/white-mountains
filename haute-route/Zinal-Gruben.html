<h1>From Zinal to Hotel Schwarzhorn in Gruben</h1>

<div id="main">

<b>Distance, Elevation Gain/Loss:</b> 16.4 km, 1,200/1,040 m<br />

<p>I reached Zinal mid-afternoon on the 30<sup>th</sup>, and after
buying two days worth of trail food (I was not sure what I would find
in Gruben for the second day) explored the area.  Specifically I was
looking for the start of next day's trail, as I had not noticed it on
my visit in 2005.  That done I had dinner and went to bed early; I had
the two final, rather long, days ahead of me.</p>

<p>On the 31<sup>st</sup> I had an early breakfast and soon got
started.  As is so often the case the trail went straight up at the
start, I was intentionally slow so as not to run out of energy too
soon.  Somewhere on that section I was passed by a group of three
young British hikers, we exchanged pleasantries and they passed me.  I
was to see them again next day.</p>

<p>The gradient soon eased, and I started the long slightly ascending
traverse to the Barneuza Alpage.  After crossing a large stream
(bridge) I took a much newer, and far less clear, trail up through the
meadows.  The tread was very faint, and there seemed to be water
everywhere, but there were enough red-white-red waymarks on small
rocks to enable me to reach the next landmark; a large barn.  Here I
had difficulty following the trail, given the many paths made by cows
and cowherds.  I managed to get through it to a delightful grassy
bowl.</p>

<p>Beyond the bowl the trail steepened again for the final assault on
the col.  The descent was steep and rocky at first, but I soon got
down to the meadows.  I soon reached the farm shown on the map
as Chalte Berg (blue placemark on map). Just above the farm I had met
a French speaking couple, and they had suggested that, rather than
attempt to follow the trail through the farm, I take the road, which
was soon rejoined by the trail.  I gladly followed their suggestion,
as I have more than once had difficulty following a trail through a
farm with its many beaten paths.</p>

<p>From here on the way was either on the road, close to it or taking
a shortcut where the road made many hairpin turns.  Shortly after the
farm I came to a junction where a trail went south to the
Turtmannhütte, which <a href="books.html#Banzhaf">Banzhaf</a> suggests
as an alternate destination.  The lake below the Turtmann glacier was
clearly visible from here.  While close to the road I saw a mountain
biker, as well as two horse riders.  Soon enough I reached the valley
about a kilometer south of the village; an easy path led me there.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hotelschwarzhorn.ch/">Hotel Schwarzhorn</a>
is a strange hybrid of hotel and mountain hut.  It has both regular
hotel rooms and dormitories.  The <a
href="http://www.hotelschwarzhorn.ch/dortoir.htm">dormitory</a> is
very much like that of a hut, as are the prices for those staying
there.  On the other hand the <a
href="http://www.hotelschwarzhorn.ch/saal.htm">dining room</a> we were
in (I believe there is another one for the room guests) was
hotel-like, and each group had its own table (including single
hikers).  I stuck up a conversation with another solitary hiker at an
adjacent table.</p>

<p>At dinner time I did not see the three young British hikers who had
passed me early in the morning.  Next day when we met I learned that
they had spent the night at the <a
href="http://www.fabricius.net/haute_route/Zinal%20to%20Gruben/pages/f.%20Restaurant%20Waldesruh.html">Restaurant
Waldesruh</a>, a few minutes north of Gruben proper.</p>
