<p>The previous evening my fellow guests at the hut had been
discussing the possibility of going over Mont Rogneux on their way to
the Cabane Panossière.  I followed this conversation with great
interest.  I had read that Mont Rogneux (3084 meters) is one of the
few 3,000 m peaks in the Valais accessible to hikers, and had also
concluded that it is possible to go east from its summit to the Cabane
Brunet.  The trail from the summit eastwards had <a
href="http://www.antonmuller.net/rogneuxweb/source/dsc_0057.htm">white-blue-white
blazes</a> (alpine trail) according to a <a
href="http://www.antonmuller.net/dotclear/index.php/2005/10/31/12-mont-rogneux-3083m">trip
report</a> I had read, and during the conversation I was told that the
initial descent from the summit involved about 100 m (vertical!) of
loose scree, a type of footing that I am most uncomfortable on.  Also
I was tired, so much so that I was considering the possibility of
skipping Mont Rogneux completely.  The obvious solution was to go to
bed, and see how I felt next morning.</p>

<p>Cabane de Mille to Cabane Brunet, with ascent of Mont Rogneux</p>

</div>

<p>I woke up in much better shape, and after breakfast felt ready to
give Mont Rogneux a try.  The weather was great, and the previous
evening's sprinkles had dried completely.  My plan was to go with my
new companions to the summit, and then evaluate the difficulty of
going down the scree slope.  If I decided not to go down that slope I
would return to the Cabane de Mille the way I had gone up, and take
the classical route to the Cabane Brunet along the northern flanks of
Mont Rogneux (part of the <a href="http://www.tourdescombins.ch/">Tour
des Combins</a>).</p>

<p>I started before my companions as I expected to be slower than they
would, and I really did not relish the idea of attempting the summit
alone.  The climb up was not too bad; the trail certainly did not seem
to deserve its "alpine trail" label.  There were steep sections, and
several areas that were steep with bad footing (crumbling rock or
scree), but all in all the ascent was not too bad.</p>

<p>After about 1½ hours I stopped to rest and wait for my companions,
who had not yet caught up with me.  Together we continued to the first
(false) summit, at 3,032 meters.  There were spectacular views in all
directions from here, the massif of the Mont Blanc to the west, the
Combins group to the south, and wonderful mountains that I was not
familiar with to the east.  My companions were much more
knowledgeable, and I envied the ease with which they identified many
summits!</p>

<p>The trail ends here, and the way to the summit is up an unmarked,
but obvious, ridge over large rocks.  Two things slowed me down: I am
uncomfortable, hence slow, on this type of terrain, and yesterday's
tiredness was returning.  I fell behind my companions and soon decided
to turn around.  i shouted a farewell to them, and we wished each other
a safe trip.</p>

<p>There were a few tricky spots on the descent, but all in all it
went well.  Shortly before rejoining the traditional route I stopped,
sat down, and had a snack.  This was my fourth consecutive day of
hiking, and I felt tired.  The hike to the Cabane Brunet should have
been easy; about 7½ km mainly downhill on good trails.  But I was
tired, and the ups and downs seemed endless.

<p>The weather was good, the views down into the Val de Bagnes were
excellent, and I passed an alpage with a delightful little lake.
Still, all I could think of was how tired I was.  My original plan had
called for two more days on the Haute Route before going to Evolène,
where I would spend the next week.  That was clearly beyond my
ability.  I decided that next day I would stop in Fionnay (nearest
village in the valley) and reconsider my plans.</p>

<p>I reached the <a
href="http://www.lesmonts.ch/fr/Refuges/refuge.php?file=brunet.html">Cabane
Brunet</a> at about 3 PM.  After announcing myself to the
<i>gardienne</i> I immediately asked her to call the <a
href="http://www.fionnay.ch/">Hôtel du Grand Combin</a> to make me a
reservation for the next night.</p>

<p>The Cabane Brunet is an unusual "mountain hut", as there is a road,
open to the general public, going right up to the hut.  So in
mid-afternoon there were many groups of day trippers who had driven up
from the valley.  They included several young families with infants.
Normally I am very tolerant of crying babies; but I was tired and must
confess that I was quite irritated by the unexpected noise.  A beer
on the Cabane's porch, with good views of one of the peaks of the
Combins, restored my sense of humor, and in any case the families all
left well before dinner time.</p>

<p>Shortly after the families left we got a few sprinkles, and like
the previous evening they increased until I went in.  Later a
full-fledged thunderstorm developed, with the thunder echoing from one
mountain to the next.  Impressive sounds, even though no lightening
was visible.</p>

<p>Because of the ease of access, the Cabane Brunet is run more as a
<i>café restaurant</i> than as a mountain hut.  For dinner, rather
than the usual communal meal, each group was seated at its own table.
We were only three groups that night: a family of four, with two very
young daughters on their first hut night; two athletic young men who
were combining two stages in one, and myself.  In spite of being
seated separately we all chatted, and after dinner the two young men
joined me for a discussion of routes.  Shortly after that we all went
to our bunks.</p>
