<h1>Col des Ignes from Arolla<br />An unsuccessful attempt</h1>

<p><b>Map used</b>: 1:50,000 Arolla hiking map, 283T</p>

<p>While climbing up the boulders to the <a
href="dix-arolla.html#tocref2">Pas de Chèvres</a> (27<sup>th</sup> of
July, 2005) I chatted briefly with a hiking couple.  They told me that
they were going a bit further north to cross over the Col des Ignes.
I had noted a path marked (on the map) with red dots; that is an
alpine route, described on the maps as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Alpine routes are trails featuring all the dangers of alpine
trecking, including short mountain climbs.  Alpine equipment or
mountain guides are essential.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since they had no technical equipment I asked about the difficulty
of the route.  They told me that the glacier had shrunk a lot, and
that the path was without any technical difficulty.  That was
confirmed by a man painting waymarks on the rocks, and a few days
later by the <i>gardien</i> of the Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges.</p>

<p>I resolved to explore the route, the fact that none of my books
even mentioned it was an added attraction.  (Back in the US I found
very little about it on the web, one of the very few articles I found
(in French) is <a
href="http://www.lesmonts.ch/fr/Courses/Ete/course.php?file=Herens.html">Une
ballade dans le haut Val d'Hérens</a>.)  On the 28<sup>th</sup> or
29<sup>th</sup> of July I decided to attempt to reach the col from
Arolla and return the same way.  On a previous hike to the Cabane des
Aiguilles Rouges I had noted a rock with "Cabane des Dix" painted on
it in big blue letters, with an arrow pointing west.  So I followed
the now familiar path up to that junction.</p>

<p>The path first rose up a rocky valley, and then moved onto the
lateral moraine with generally very good footing.  The steepness
varied, but nowhere was it really steep.  Soon I passed the much
shrunken remains of the glacier; it still had an impressive ice arch,
with water gushing out from under it</p>

<p>The path was marked with the blue, white, blue waymarks of an
alpine route, as well as a large number of metal stakes with the blue,
white, blue markings.  Where the tread was clear the waymarks were
some distance apart, but where there was no definite tread they were
much closer together.  At no point should there have been any
ambiguity about the correct route.</p>

<p>I wrote "... should there have been ..." rather than "... was there
..." since I did something rather stupid.  The path was following the
crest of the moraine, and after a large metal stake I could not see
the next waymark.  For some reason I simply continued along the
moraine crest.  When I had gone about ten minutes without seeing a
waymark it finally dawned on me that the trail must have turned at the
last stake I had seen.  I had no difficulty returning to the last
stake, and once there looked carefully in all directions.  I soon
found the missing waymark; the path left the moraine to the left,
descending into the valley.</p>

<p>At that stage I began to feel tired, and the weather seemed to be
deteriorating (the forecast called for afternoon thunderstorms).  I
had convinced myself that I could easily follow this "alpine route",
and so felt that I had accomplished what I had set out to do.  So I
turned around, and planned to go back to the Dixence dam and cross
over to the Val d'Arolla by the Col des Ignes in a few days.</p>

<p><a href="riedmatten-aiguilles-rouges.html">That trip</a> was also
unsuccessful, and it was not until <a
href="dix-col-des-ignes.html">July 2008</a> that I succeeded, three
full years after I first planned to cross it.</p>
