<p>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of August I planned to go from the Grande
Dixence dam to the Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges by the <a
href="col-des-ignes.html">Col des Ignes</a>.  As the title of this
page implies I ended up going over the Col de Riedmatten.  The day
before I had called the <i>gardien</i> to make a reservation, and
asked about the Col des Ignes route.  He confirmed that it was
normally easy, but warned that it had snowed above 3,000 meters that
day, and that the col is at an elevation of over 3,100 meters.  Since
the path to the Col des Ignes branches off the one to the Col de
Riedmatten I planned to decide which col to take when I got to the
junction.</p>

<p>From Le Chargeur to Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges to La
Gouille</p>

</div>


<p>As I was now staying in Evolène I was able to take the first bus,
reaching Vex in time to take the 7:30 bus to La Dixence, arriving
there at 8:20.  Since the cable car does not start running until 9:35
I reluctantly walked up to the top of the dam.  It was a thoroughly
uninteresting walk, but got me up at a more appropriate time than on
my previous trip to the Cabane des Dix.  It also added 300 meters of
elevation gain to what was going to be a <i>very</i> long day!</p>

<p>The walk along the lake was monotonous, as the low clouds
completely obstructed the views.  Shortly after reaching the SE corner
of the lake the trail heads up and to the south, after a short
distance the trail to the cols branches to the left, while the trail
to the Cabane des Dix goes straight.  The trail to the cols soon
crosses the inlet stream.  The descriptions of the old bridge over the
lake inlet were a bit scary, the current bridge is totally
non-threatening.</p>

<p>The trail along the east side of the valley rises gradually,
crossing several boulder fields and a couple of streams, one of which
was rather difficult to cross.  When I reached the point where the
trail to the Col des Ignes branches off I hesitated.  Visibility was
poor, the trail is little used, and the hut <i>gardien</i> had warned
me that it had snowed high up.  So, reluctantly, I continued up the
valley to the point where the trail starts its steep ascent up to the
Col de Riedmatten.  (In <a href="dix-col-des-ignes.html">July 2008</a>
I finally crossed the col from the Cabane des Dix to the Cabane des
Aiguilles Rouges)</p>

<p>The climb up to the col was unpleasant: <i>very</i> steep, with bad
(slippery) footing. A few days ago I had heard a hiker in Arolla
complain about that route's steepness and slipperiness, with the
previous day's rain it was very unpleasant.  I definitely found the
Pas de Chèvres much easier and pleasanter.</p>

<p>From the col there is a steep descent, after which the the trail
fortunately becomes rather easy.  At the point marked 2399 on the map a
wide track crosses the trail; it is not marked but it is completely
clear from the map that the track leads to Pra Gras.  Shortly
thereafter the track branched; as I was looking at my map a small
truck stopped and a farmer asked me where I was headed.  When I told
her I was going to Pra Gras she confirmed that I should take the left
fork, and also warned me that I would meet an electric fence.  She
kindly explained how to open the gate; there is an insulated handle.
I thanked her and went on my way.</p>

<p>From there it was a long slog to the Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges,
the path was relatively easy but I was tired, had been walking in the
clouds and mist all day (no rain, fortunately), and was beginning to
feel sorry for myself.  I got to the Cabane before dinner time, and
quickly had a beer, which lifted my spirits immensely.</p>

<p>The Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges is not a frequent overnight
destination for hikers, though many visit it by day as part of a
classic loop from Arolla.  I was the only hiker that night, all the
other guests were climbers planning some sort of adventure on the
Aiguilles Rouges.  I was also apparently the only guest over thirty
years old!  So, given the difference in age and in interests, I was
pretty much on my own that night.</p>

<p>Next morning the weather had improved markedly, and visibility was
excellent.  The view to the east from the Cabane is exceptional, with
the east wall of the Val d'Hérens and its many sharp Aiguilles (above
all the Aiguille de la Tsa) and the glaciated summits of Mont Collon
and, further away, the Dent Blanche.  Both Kev Reynolds (in his <a
href="maps.html#KevValais">Walking in the Valais</a>) and Philippe
Noth, in his <a href="http://www.noth.ch/h0127_e.html">Cabane des
Aiguilles Rouges</a> page, describe the descent to Lac Bleu as tiring.
I did not find it so, perhaps because for almost half an hour I was
able to watch a herd of chamoix bounding up and down the slopes; an
unforgettable sight!  At la Gouille I had a second breakfast while
waiting for the bus which took me back to Evolène.</p>
