<p>On Friday the 5<sup>th</sup> of August I packed my belongings, and
sent everything except my backpack to Geneva.  Next day I set out
for Zinal, spending the first night at the Cabane de Moiry.</p>

<p>As I had often walked from Evolène or les Haudères to the villages
of La Sage and La Forclaz I felt that taking the early morning bus to
la Forclaz was not "cheating".  It saved me about three kilometers and
300 meters of elevation gain.</p>

<p>From La Forclaz to the Cabane de Moiry</p>

</div>


<p>From La Forclaz to Motau (about 1¼ kilometers with 200
meters elevation gain) was easy, then the trail started getting
steep.  At about 2,100 meters there is a choice; either take an easy
switchback or go straight up.  I chose to go straight up, and a bit
before reaching Le Tsaté stopped to catch my breath and enjoy the
scenery.  While stopped I heard voices speaking English; I waited to
see who they belonged to.  A couple soon appeared, and I greeted them
with a short "Damned steep!!".  They laughed and agreed that taking
the switchback would have been easier.  Soon we were joined by a
second British couple.</p>

<p>We hiked up together to the cowsheds that are the Remointse du
Tsaté, taking the road for the last switchback rather than following
the trail straight up.  There we parted, with the faster British group
going ahead.  Shortly beyond the cowsheds there is a fork which I did
not see, and I took the wrong branch.  After some time I heard voices
far away; they were clearly to my right (south of me) rather than
ahead of me, so I had a good look at the map.  Realizing my mistake I
turned around.</p>

<p>Later I found that the path I took leads to the Lac du Tsaté, from
which it is possible to ascend the Pointe du Tsaté.  <a
href="maps.html#Banzhaf">Banzhaf</a> suggests, as a variation, going
up the Pointe du Tsaté.  From the summit he suggests returning to the
lake, and from there following a rough path that leads to the standard
route.  This adds about three hours to what is already a long
trip!</p>

<p>Shortly after rejoining the correct trail I was passed by a young
couple.  We chatted for a couple of minutes, and I told them about my
mistake.  They laughed, having done the same thing on a previous trip!
Today they were doing an interesting trip.  They were going over the
Col du Tsaté, then down to the Lac de la Bayenna, from which they
planned to go north on the Haut Tour du Lac, at the 2,500 meter
contour, to the Alpage du Torrent, where they would pick up the trail
ascending to the Col de Torrent, from where they would return.</p>

<p>I rejoined the British group at the col, where they had stopped for
a long time to enjoy the views.  We descended together, and stopped
again at the pretty Lac de la Bayenna, and once again at the small
<i>buvette</i> at the Parking du Glacier, where we had some
refreshments.</p>

<p>We then turned south for the final push to the Cabane de Moiry,
about three kilometers and 400 meters away.  At first the path was
easy, then we started walking on the crest of the lateral moraine,
which gradually got narrower.  Many paths went down from the crest; I
left it early as I was uncomfortable on the narrow ridge.  There were
many patches of snow or ice in the depression besides the moraine.
Finally we got to a steep climb, with innumerable switchbacks, leading
to the hut.</p>
