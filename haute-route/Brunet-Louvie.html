<p>On the 19<sup>th</sup> of July I walked down from the Cabane Brunet
to Fionnay, where I spent two nights, before going (by bus, train,
bus) to Evolène for a week.  Then, on the 28<sup>th</sup> of July I
returned to Fionnay, and climbed up to the Cabane du Lac de Louvie.
Since most hikers would do this as single stage I have combined them
here.</p>

<p>From Cabane Brunet to Cabane de Louvie</p>

</div>

<p>I woke up still tired, and was glad that I was about to interrupt
my trip.  The previous night's clouds and showers were gone, and after
breakfast I started down to Fionnay.  The hike was short (about 5¾
km), but the downhill section was very steep and slippery, as there
were a lot of coniferous needles on the ground.  To make matters worse
(remember, I was very tired!) the trail reached the valley about two
kilometers and 150 vertical meters below Fionnay, with most of the
ascent toward the end.  While it was annoying it was a short hike,
even in my tired state.</p>

<p>My original plan had called for me to continue up to the Cabane de
Louvie, and I had been planning on buying lunch food for that day and
the next two in Fionnay.  I discovered that Fionnay is so small a
village that it has no food stores!  I took a bus to Lourtier, and two
hours later took the return bus.  Since the Cabane du Lac de Louvie is
not very far away, that would have worked even had I been continuing
onward.</p>

<p>Next day (Friday) I did a short hike with great views on the
Combins massif, and on Saturday morning left for Evolène, where I had
rented a delightful apartment in a chalet with a great view on the
Dent Blanche.  I spent a week there, doing several hikes (some quite
short, others much more strenuous).  Then on the 28<sup>th</sup> of
July I returned to Fionnay, arriving at about 14:30.</p>

<p>I immediately started hiking to the cabane.  The hike is quite
short (about 4 kilometers) but steep, with a bit over 1,000 meters of
elevation gain.  There is an area where the trail is on the edge of a
precipice, with moderate exposure, but many chains for safety and,
more to the point, reassurance.  As I was going up I met many hikers
going down; they had gone up to spend the day at this scenic and
accessible cabane.  I went up at a fast pace, something I was to
regret the next day.</p>

<p>The cabane is on a rise above the lake, with wonderful views of the
lake and its surrounding mountains.  In the evening those with
binoculars could see a group of chamois high up on those slopes.  The
weather was excellent, so I had my post-hike beer outside, enjoying
the views and watching my fellow hikers.</p>

<p>Each bunk room in this cabane has a name: "writers", "painters",
"philosophers" and so on; I was assigned to the philosophers bunk room,
and chose the bunk labeled "Kant".</p>
