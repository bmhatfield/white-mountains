<h1>Choosing a Route</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>There are many ways of going from Chamonix to Zermatt.  Most
English speakers follow the route described by <a
href="books.html#KevHR">Kev Reynolds</a>, but that book describes a
few variations.  The two Swiss publications, the slim <a
href="books.html#VALRANDO">VALRANDO</a> brochure and the book by <a
href="books.html#Banzhaf">Bernhard Rudolf Banzhaf</a>, describe
several other variations.  Finally, looking at the map suggested still
more possibilities.  I will describe the various major options; many
more minor variations are possible.</p>

<h2>Trient or La Forclaz to Champex</h2>

<p>The two routes from Trient (or La Forclaz) are very different.  The
high road goes over the high Fenêtre d'Arpette (2,665 meters), with a
strenuous ascent and a steep and rocky descent.  The low road goes
over a ridge at around 2,000 meters.</p>

<div class="C">

</div>

<p>As a result the Fenêtre d'Arpette route is more scenic but also
more strenuous.  It is also not advisable to use it in bad weather.
In 2008 we were advised not to use it after an evening storm
followed by a cold night, for fear of icing.</p>



<h2>Champex to Cabane de Prafleuri</h2>

<p>The area where the routes differ most is between Champex and the
Col de Louvie.  The (interactive) Google Map below compares three routes: Kev
Reynold's route (in red), the VALRANDO route (in blue) and the route I
took (in black).</p>

</div>

<p class="C"><b>Three possible routes: Kev Reynolds (red), VALRANDO
(blue) and my "compromise" (black)</b></p>

<p>In what follows I am assuming that the reader has access to the
Reynolds book (almost all English speaking walkers seem to use it),
the free VALRANDO brochure and one of the appropriate (282, 282T, 5003
or 5027T) maps.</p>

<h3>Reynolds' Route</h3>

<p>Reynolds chose a low elevation northern approach, getting very
close to the Rhône valley at Sembrancher, then climbing up to the
Cabane du Mont Fort, attempting to avoid the worse of the ski slopes
near Verbier.  From there his two suggested routes go to the Col de
Louvie and on to the Cabane de Prafleuri.</p>

<p>I believe that most readers of his book want to go all the way from
Chamonix to Zermatt in a single trip during a two week holiday, and
for them it may well be the only way.  Some people, such as I, plan to
do it over two or more trips, and for them there are other
options.</p>

<h3>The Swiss Routes</h3>

<p>The two Swiss publications both chose much more southerly routes,
with passes at substantially higher elevations.  The VALRANDO route
actually crosses over into Italy by the Col de Fenêtre, returning to
Switzerland by the Col du Grand Saint-Bernard. Banzhaf's route is only
slightly more northerly, crossing into the Val d'Entremont by the Col
du Bastillon.  Both routes then descend to the valley at
Bourg-St-Pierre.  From there they climb up to the Col de Mille, and
after passing the Cabane Brunet go to the Cabane FXB-Panossière.  From
there they loop south to different degrees before heading to the
Cabane de Louvie, from which they rejoin the Reynolds route before the
Col de Louvie.</p>

<h3>My Compromise</h3>

<p>Since I planned to do the route over a few trips I saw no need to
go down into the valley as Reynolds' route does.  On the other hand I
feel that the two Swiss routes go too far south for what I consider to
be a traverse.  My compromise is to cross over from the Val Ferret to
the Val d'Entremont by a more northerly pass.  I had initially favored
a route leaving Praz-de-Fort, crossing the ridge at La Tèjere and
descending to Liddes.  Finding absolutely nothing about it either in
print or on the web I decided to follow the <a
href="http://www.tourdusaintbernard.com/parcours.htm">Tour du
St-Bernard</a> route.  This leaves from La Fouly, crosses the ridge at
Le Basset, and descends to Liddes.  From Liddes I went over the Col de
Mille to the Cabane Brunet, from which I went directly to the Cabane
de Louvie, rejoining the Swiss routes.</p>

<h2>From Prafleuri to the Val d'Hérens</h2>

<p>The standard route is to go from the Cabane de Prafleuri directly
to either of the two passes (Col de Riedmatten or Pas de Chèvres),
then descend to Arolla for the night.  Next day take an interesting
trail above the valley to the Lac Bleu, then descend to La Gouille and
follow the old road to Les Haudères.  A variant is to detour to the
Cabane des Dix, with its spectacular views, and then cross the
remains of the Glacier de Cheilon to the cols and Arolla.  With this
variant there is the option of spending a night at the Cabane.  The
standard route and its variant are shown in red on the map below.</p>

<div class="C">

<iframe width="500" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;t=p&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.00047077759131c519813&amp;ll=46.051076,7.440491&amp;spn=0.095309,0.171661&amp;z=12&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;t=p&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.00047077759131c519813&amp;ll=46.051076,7.440491&amp;spn=0.095309,0.171661&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">Prafleuri-Herens</a> in a larger map</small>

</div>

<p>The third edition of Reynolds' book suggested a variant (dropped in
the fourth edition) for those spending a night at the Cabane des Dix.
After crossing the col descend about half way to Arolla, then take a
farm road to the delightful Remointse de Pra Gra and from there follow
the trail to the Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges.  This Cabane has
wonderful views, both of the icy peaks to the south and the rock wall
that separates the Val d'Arolla from the Val de Ferpècle.  Next day
descend to the Lac Bleu and follow the standard route to Les Haudères.
The detour is shown in black on the map.</p>

<p>An alternative that I have never seen discussed, but that I enjoyed
immensely on my <a href="dix-col-des-ignes.html#tocref2">2008
trip</a>, uses the high (3,181 meters) Col des Ignes.  This route is
shown in blue on the map.  From the Cabane des Dix cross the glacier,
then go north for about half a kilometer, and cross the col to reach
the Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges.  Zooming in on the map, by clicking
where the blue line leaves the red one, will show the start of this
route in more detail.  It is also possible to go from the Cabane de
Prafleuri to the Cabane des Aiguilles Rouges in a single, very long,
day.  I have not attempted it!</p>

<h3>Where to spend the night?</h3>

<p>Reynolds suggests spending the night in La Sage, a tiny village
above the valley about an hour's walk from Les Haudères.  This
obviously saves some time next day.  You may well prefer to stay in
one of the two large valley villages, Les Haudères or Evolène.  They
have a much bigger choice of both food and lodging.  Next day you may
walk to the start or, if you are not an absolute purist, use the bus.
Inquire about the bus schedule (fewer and later buses on weekends)
before making plans.</p>

<h2>Val d'Hérens to Val d'Anniviers</h2>

<p>The southern route (in red on map), over the Col du Tsaté, is the
more demanding route.  After going over the col and descending to the
valley it crosses the outflow of the glacier, and goes south ascending
to the Cabane de Moiry.  This high (2,825 meters) hut has spectacular
views of the glacier and its icefall, as well as of the surrounding
mountains.</p>


<div class="C">

<iframe width="425" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.000470832f4f72a821766&amp;ll=46.134408,7.577133&amp;spn=0.10706,0.145912&amp;t=p&amp;z=12&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.000470832f4f72a821766&amp;ll=46.134408,7.577133&amp;spn=0.10706,0.145912&amp;t=p&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">Herens to Anniviers</a> in a larger map</small>

</div>

<p>Next day you retrace your steps to the bottom of the glacier, then
follow a path above the lake, at around 2,500 meters.  At the head of
the lake a path comes up from the dam (used by the alternate route)
and then both go over the Col de Sorebois through pleasant pastures.
The descent is less pleasant, as it is through a ski area.  The
distant views, though, compensate.  There is a restaurant at the upper
station of the cable car, where I had a very satisfying lunch.  I
decided to take the cable car down to avoid what Reynolds describes as
a "knee-jarring descent".  Purists may well wish to jar their knees on
the descent to Zinal!</p>

<p>The alternative pass is the Col de Torrent (first day route shown
in black). I did not go over the col, just up and back from Evolène in
2005, and enjoyed the immense Alp Cotter very much.  The route then
reaches the valley at the dam, where there is lodging at the Chalet du
Glacier.  Next day a short climb rejoins the route coming from the
Cabane, and ascends as described above to the Col de Sorebois.</p>

<p>From there one may descend (on foot or by cable car) directly to
Zinal.  Since this route is quite a bit shorter than the one coming
from the Cabane de Moiry Reynolds suggested (in the third edition,
removed in fourth) following a path above the valley to the Cabane du
Petit Mountet, and going to Zinal from there (in blue on the map).
The views going to the Cabane are spectacular!  It is also possible to
stay at the Cabane, going to the Hotel Weisshorn next day (this is the
route suggested in the <a href="books.html#VALRANDO">VALRANDO</a>
brochure).</p>

<p>As an alternative to staying at the Chalet du Barrage near the dam
it is possible to go (walking or by bus) to Grimentz, a large village
in the valley.  Some may wish to go there for the greater choice of
accommodation, these will return to the dam (almost certainly by bus)
next day and resume the itinerary described above.  Reynolds suggests
several alternatives for those staying in Grimentz; in my opinion the
only really logical one is to go next day to the Hotel Weisshorn.</p>

<h2>Val d'Anniviers to Turtmanntal</h2>

<p>There are two passes between the French-speaking Val d'Anniviers
and the German-speaking Turtmanntal, the Meidipass to the north (blue
placemark on map) and the Forcletta to the south (red placemark).  From
Zinal it is quite easy to go over in a day, while those spending a
night in Grimentz or at the Petit Mountet hut will need to spend
another night at the Hotel Weisshorn or the Bella Tolla hut.  Almost
everyone goes to Gruben in the Turtmanntal, though Banzhaf suggests a
detour to spend the night at the Turtmann hut.</p>

<div class="C">

<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.000470b279ab6ba81e486&amp;ll=46.166517,7.655411&amp;spn=0.166441,0.291824&amp;t=p&amp;z=11&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.000470b279ab6ba81e486&amp;ll=46.166517,7.655411&amp;spn=0.166441,0.291824&amp;t=p&amp;z=11&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">Anniviers to Turtmanntal</a> in a larger map</small>

</div>

<p>Reynolds' standard route goes from Zinal over the Forcletta to
Gruben, a route that is both direct and scenic.  From Zinal he
suggests two variations, going further north high up in the Val
d'Anniviers to ether the Hotel Weisshorn or, in the fourth edition, to
the Bella Tolla hut.  This is a very scenic route, but unfortunately
you have to turn around to see the best views.  Next day go over the
Meidipass to Gruben.</p>

<p>Those spending the night in Grimentz will go to either the Hotel
Weisshorn or the Bella Tolla hut, next day going over the Meidipass to
Gruben.  Those spending the night at the Petit Mountet hut (the
VALRANDO route) will hike to the Hotel Weisshorn high above Zinal, a
delightful scenic hike with the only problem being that you have to
stop and turn around for the best views.</p>

<h2>Turtmanntal to Zermatt</h2>

<p>There is only one pass between the Turtmanntal and the Mattertal,
the Augustbordpass.  The main route from Gruben goes directly to the
pass, after about a kilometer the route from the Turtmannhütte joins
it.  The final descent from Jungu to St. Niklaus is very steep; I
chose to take the cable car down.  I had a long wait as the cable car
does not operate between 11:00 and 13:00, lunch time!</p>

<div class="C">

<iframe width="425" height="475" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.0004713443259df871029&amp;ll=46.120369,7.763901&amp;spn=0.226073,0.291824&amp;t=p&amp;z=11&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103828115753497871383.0004713443259df871029&amp;ll=46.120369,7.763901&amp;spn=0.226073,0.291824&amp;t=p&amp;z=11&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">Gruben to Zermatt</a> in a larger map</small>

</div>

<p>There are two very different routes between St. Niklaus and
Zermatt.  The valley route more or less follows the road and river, it
is flat, easy and of limited interest.  The newer Europaweg is the
exact opposite: lots of ascent, rough terrain and spectacular views.
It requires two days as opposed to one for the valley route, with a
night spent midway at the Europahütte.  It crosses two or three areas
of active rockfall where caution, and speed, are required.</p>

<p>Those taking the Europaweg have a dilema, unless they are very
fit.  That route starts at Gasenried, 1:40 above St. Niklaus according
to Reynolds.  It is a lot to add at the end of the long trek from
Gruben to St. Niklaus, and also a lot to add at the start of the
equally long trek from Gasenried to the Europahütte.  So Reynolds
suggests devoting an extra day for it.  Unless you are a total purist
I would strongly recommend taking the bus, either the afternoon you
arrive in St. Niklaus, or early next morning.</p>
