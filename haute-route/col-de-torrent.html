<p><b>Map used</b>: 1:50,000 Arolla hiking map, 283T<br /></p>

<p>After a week in Arolla I moved to Evolène on the 30<sup>th</sup> of
July, which opened up a new set of possible exploratory trips.  On the
1<sup>st</sup> of August I went from Evolène to the Col de Torrent,
returning the same way.  Evolène is quite a bit lower than Arolla
(roughly at 1,300 meters while Arolla is at about 2,000 meters) and
the Col de Torrent is at about 2,900 meters, giving a climb of about
1,530 meters and a round trip distance of about 17 kilometers.  This
was my most challenging hike so far.</p>

<p>From Evolène to Col de Torrent</p>
</div>




<p>I followed the road south (towards Les Haudères) for a short
distance, then took a path that climbed, at times very steeply, up the
eastern wall of the valley towards Villa, which I reached in about an
hour.  Villa is the most northern of the three villages above the
valley, La Sage (where many Haute Route trekkers spend a night) is the
middle one, and La Forclaz, where the route to the Col du Tsaté
starts, is the most southerly.</p>

<p>From Villa a cobbled road leads up as steeply as the path had, and
then it becomes a track.  That track winds high up the mountain,
reaching the many chalets of the vaste Alp Cotter, and is marked on
one of my maps as a mountain bicycle path.  It seems that many of the
chalets here are rented to vacationers, as many of the cars had foreign
license plates.  At times the route follows the track, at others it
used paths to cut the very long switchbacks, and at all times it was
unambiguously marked.</p>

<p>At an elevation of about 2,000 meters there is a very sharp hairpin
turn in the road, with a clear signpost. The <a
href="http://www.hotel-kurhaus.arolla.com/ete/val-herens-tour.php3">Tour
du Val d'Hérens</a> route continues straight ahead (north) headed
towards Volovron, while the route to the Col de Torrent heads east
towards a collection of houses.  Here our trail leaves the road for
good, and starts a moderately steep ascent.  The ascent is through a
lovely alpine pasture, with gentle pastoral views in the foreground
and the impressive mountains in the background.</p>

<p>At about 2,500 meters there is a delightful small (tiny might be a
better adjective) pond where I stopped for lunch.  Then onward and
upward!  The last 150 or so vertical meters to the col were a bit
difficult; the trail was very steep on slippery slate.</p>

<p>I met a few groups of hikers on the col, and one group was going
north along the ridge to the nearby summit of Sasseneire (a 3,000
meter peak with no trail).  After enjoying the views on both sides I
descended.  On the descent I had wonderful views both of the mountains
to the west and the surrounding meadows.  It was a hike worth
celebrating; strenuous and with great views.  A half bottle of
champagne seemed the appropriate reward for my hard day's work!!</p>
