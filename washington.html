<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>You may want to look at the <a href="spresi.html">Southern
Presidentials</a> page for information on the huts and campsites in
the areas, and for hikes that combine Mt. Washington with other
peaks in that range.</p>

<h2><a name="Warning" id="Warning"></a>Warning!</h2>

<p>Mount Washington has the reputation of being "Home of the
world's worst weather". Severe storms, including snow, can happen
at any time of the year. The combination of severe winds, cold and
wetness can exhaust the strongest hiker. Never continue upwards in
deteriorating weather, as it gets worse at higher elevations.</p>

<p>Also note that it is a strenuous climb for those who are not in
good shape. The distance by most routes is around four miles each
way; that may not sound like much. But in those four miles you gain
roughly 4,000 feet of elevation, which is a lot for those not used
to strenuous exercise. To quote the <i>White Mountain
Guide</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To a person unused to mountain trails or in less than excellent
physical condition, this unrelenting uphill grind can be grueling
and intensely discouraging. If you are not an experienced hiker or
a trained athlete, you will almost certainly enjoy the ascent of
Mount Washington a great deal more if you build up to it with
easier climbs in areas with less exposure to potentially severe
weather.</p>

<h2><a name="Washington" id="Washington"></a>Mount Washington
Trails</h2>

<p>Mount Washington is the highest peak in the White Mountains of
New Hampshire (and indeed in the Northeast) and is therefore a very
popular objective. As a result the most widely used trails can be
quite crowded, and however you climb the summit will have crowds,
many having come up by the road or the Cog Railway.</p>

<p><a name="Tucks" id="Tucks"></a>The most common way to ascend it
is from Pinkham Notch by the <b>Tuckerman's Ravine</b> trail [rt:
8.4 miles, 4,300 feet, 6:20]. The first 2.4 miles, to the Hermit
Lake shelters, is wide and relatively smooth going. But do not be
fooled, you are going up, climbing about 1,800 feet in these 2.4
miles. The <i>White Mountain Guide</i> describes this section well,
noting " ... its moderate but relentless climb ...". Soon the trail
attacks the ravine headwall, here it becomes really steep! The last
section, up the summit cone of Mt. Washington, is another steep
ascent over large rocks, more "rock-hopping" than trail
walking.</p>

<p><a name="Lion" id="Lion"></a>Less crowded routes are available
from Pinkham. The <b>Lion's Head</b> trail is about the same length
as the Tuckerman's Ravine trail, it is steeper and rougher. In
exchange you get better views and less crowds (Until you reach the
summit of Mt. Washington, which is always crowded). You may wish to
avoid the steep rocks on the way down by returning via Tuckerman's
Ravine.</p>

<p><a name="Boott" id="Boott"></a>On the other side of the ravine
is the <b>Boott Spur</b> trail (<b>note</b> Boott, not Boot Spur!),
which also has great views. It is longer than either of the above
[rt: 10.8 miles, 4,300 feet, 7:35], but no more difficult than
Tuckerman's Ravine. A loop using Boott Spur and Tuckerman's Ravine
is a popular trip [lp: 9.6 miles, 4,300 feet, 6:55]. If you really
wish to avoid the crowds as much as possible return by the Lions
Head trail, though it is steeper and rougher than Tuckerman's.</p>

<p>Two trails approach Mt. Washington from the West, both starting
from the same trailhead (on the Base Road that leads to the Cog
Railway station). This trailhead is about 500 feet higher than
Pinkham, so you save that much elevation gain. Either trail can be
used for a round trip, though many use both to make a loop.</p>

<p>The <a name="Ammo" id="Ammo"></a><b>Ammonoosuc Ravine</b> trail
(combined with the <b>Crawford Path</b>) is the shorter of the two
[rt: 9.0 miles, 3,800 feet, 6:25], and affords shelter at the Lake
of the Clouds hut. On the other hand there is a rather long section
that is steep, rocky and usually wet.</p>

<p>The <a name="Jewell" id="Jewell"></a><b>Jewell</b> trail
(combined with the <b>Gulfside</b>) is longer [rt: 10.2 miles,
4,000 feet, 7:05] but is the easiest way up Mount Washington (a
relative term, there is no easy way to the top of Mt. Washington!).
Combining the two makes a very popular loop [lp: 9.6 miles, 3,900
feet, 6:45]. You may want to read my report of a trip to
<a href="mt-washington-ammonoosuc.html">Mount Washington by the
Ammonoosuc and Jewell Trails</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Gulf" id="Gulf"></a>Of the many other less commonly used
trails up Mt. Washington I will only mention the <b>Great Gulf
Trail</b>. That trail goes through the Great Gulf for 6.5 miles to
Spaulding Lake (elevation 4,228 feet), then goes up the very steep
headwall, rising 1,600 feet in about 0.8 mile! It then joins the
Gulfside trail for an easy ascent up to the summit of Mount Washington
(ow: 7.9 miles; 5,000 feet; 6:25). With only one car you may have to
return the same way, many find going down the headwall unpleasant (rt:
15.8 miles; 5,000 feet; 10:25). With a second car (or the willingness
to thumb a ride), it is possible to go down by the gentler Tuckerman's
Ravine or Lion's Head trails (lp: 12.1 miles; 5,000 feet; 8:35). This
is a strenuous trip, but the views while climbing the headwall are
amongst the most spectacular in the White Mountains.  See my trip
report of <a href="great-gulf.html">Hiking Mount Washington by the
Great Gulf Trail</a> for a description of my 2002 trip.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the most used routes to Mount Washington:</p>

<h2><a name="Choice" id="Choice"></a>Choosing a Route</h2>

<p>There are an enormous number of trails going up Mount Washington,
and each of them has something to recommend it.  I will just mention
those that seem to me to be the most suitable for a first climb up
Mount Washington.</p>

<p>The most commonly used route is Tuckerman's Ravine, which is rather
crowded on summer weekends.  There is, of course, an excellent reason
why it is the most popular route, as it takes you into the floor of
the great ravine.  For variety, and to minimize crowds, I would
suggest combining it with either Lion's Head or Boott Spur.  Both have
excellent views into the ravine from above; of these Lion's Head is
the more scenic, and also the more crowded.</p>

<p>The routes from the west start off at a higher elevation, saving
about 500 feet of elevation.  The Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail is far more
scenic than the Jewell trail, but also much steeper.  Many hikers
combine the two trails, going up the Ammonoosuc Ravine and down the
Jewell trail.  This loop gets Mount Monroe at almost no extra
effort!</p>

<p>The Great Gulf Trail is substantially longer, steeper and has more
elevation gain than any of the others.  For those with the fitness to
do it the views (when the weather cooperates!) make it well worth
while.</p>

<p>Many people do Mount Washington using the huts, either because they
enjoy the huts, or to minimize the elevation gain on any given day.
Some do it as an <a href="spresi.html#tocref7">overnight</a>, going to
Lakes Hut the first day, then summitting Mount Washington the second.
It is usual to climb Mount Monroe after reaching the hut, and to
descend by the Jewell Trail.</p>

<p>Others do a three or four day <a href="hut-traverse.html">hut
traverse</a>, which has its own description.</p>
