Zealand Hut (elevation 2,700 feet) is located near Zealand Falls,
on Whitewall Brook. 

<p>In summer it is a short 3 mile hike with little elevation gain
from the trailhead, but in winter, when the Zealand Road is closed,
the trip is over 6 miles. In summer the short distance plus the
falls makes the hut very popular with families with young children.
In winter it is used by XC skiers, by recreational snowshoers and
by peakbaggers wanting to break some of the longer trips into more
manageable pieces.</p>

<p>The AMC web site has a page on the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-zealand.cfm">Zealand Hut</a>, with information on the hut,
season of operation and rates.  Here I give hiking information that
supplements what they offer, describing the most frequently used
access routes (with distances, elevation gains and <a
href="faq1.html#booktime1">book time</a>), and <i>some</i> of the
trips that can utilize the hut, including hut to hut trips.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref0" id="tocref0"></a>Zealand Falls Hut in
Winter</h2>

<p>It is open in winter on a "self service" basis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At AMC Self-service huts, guests
provide their own food and have full use of the hut's stove, oven, and
cookware to prepare their own meals. Bunks, mattresses, and pillows are
provided, but blankets are not. Be sure to bring a warm sleeping bag if
you're staying at a self-service hut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In winter the dining and cooking area is heated (moderately!),
and as the bunkrooms are adjacent to the dining area a three season
sleeping bag, rated to 20&deg;F, is probably adequate.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Getting to Zealand Falls Hut
and Back</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Zealand Trail</h3>

<p>The easiest way to the hut is by the Zealand Trail, which
follows the Zealand River (not too closely) at an easy grade most
of the way (ow: 2.8 miles; 650 feet; 1:45). There is a short steep
section at the very end. The return trip is downhill all the way.
In winter the Zealand Road is closed, and parking is on Rt 302
about 0.3 miles from the start of the Zealand Road. This adds 3.8
miles and 450 feet to the trip, for a total of 6.6 miles, 1,100
feet and a book time of 3:50.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Hale Brook and Lend a Hand
Trails</h3>

<p>A longer way of reaching the hut is to drive 2.5 miles down the
Forest Service Zealand Road to the Hale Brook trailhead. From there
the Hale Brook Trail goes to the summit of Mount Hale, from which
the Lend a Hand Trail descends to the hut (ow: 5.0 miles; 1,300
feet; 3:10). In winter add 2.8 miles plus 250 feet for the road
walk, for an extra 1:30 of book time. Note that the Hale Brook
Trail is often broken in winter before the Lend a Hand Trail, so
you may be in for a surprise on the summit. The return trip
involves 1,300 feet of elevation gain over the same distance, for a
book time of 2:40. Add 1:25 for the road walk in winter.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>From Crawford Notch</h3>

<p>The Avalon and A-Z (Avalon to Zealand) trails approach the hut
from Crawford Notch (ow: 5.5 miles; 2,000 feet; 3:45). The
substantial elevation gain is due to the fact that the hight of
land between Mounts Tom and Field is at 3,700 feet. Consequently
adding either peak to the trip is not too difficult. Including
Mount Tom will add 1.2 miles and 350 feet (adding 0:45 to book
time), while Mount Field will add 1.8 miles and 650 feet (adding
1:15 to book time).</p>

<p>The return trip by the A-Z and Avalon trails has 800 feet less
elevation gain, and a book time of 3:20.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Hikes From Zealand Falls
Hut</h2>

<p>A large variety of hikes are available from the hut, ranging
from an almost level walk to Thoreau Falls to a grueling trip over
all three Bonds.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Thoreau Falls</h3>

<p>The falls are obviously best seen when the water is high, but
are well worth the trip at any time. From the hut return to the
junction of the Zealand and Ethan Pond trails, and follow the
latter for about 2.5 flat miles to its junction with the Thoreau
Falls Trail. After about 0.1 mile on the latter trail you will
reach the ledges at the head of the Falls (rt: 4.8 miles; 150 feet;
2:30).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Zeacliff and Zeacliff
Pond</h3>

<p>Zeacliff is an outlook with excellent views over the
Pemigewasset Wilderness. It is reached from the hut by the Twinway,
and includes a rather steep section (rt: 2.4 miles; 1,100 feet;
1:45). The crossing of Whitewall Brook at the start of the trail
can be difficult at high water. Zeacliff Pond is reached by a side
trail that leaves the Twinway about 0.4 miles beyond the
outlook.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7a" id="tocref7a"></a>Zealand Mountain and the
Bonds</h3>

<p>The Twinway continues beyond Zeacliff, reaching Zealand Mountain
2.9 miles from the hut. This viewless peak is one that only a
peakbagger could love (rt: 5.8 miles, 1,600 feet, 3:40). Beyond
that the trail gets much more interesting. Mt. Guyot is reached at
3.2 miles, it is a bare peak with excellent views in all directions
(rt: 6.4 miles, 2,250 feet, 4:20). Ambitious peakbaggers can now
turn south and bag two or three of the Bonds. All three Bonds are
14.2 miles and 4,200 feet, with a book time of 9:10, while Bond and
West Bond are only 11.8 miles and 3,500 feet, with a book time of
7:40.</p>

<p>In winter this is a very challenging trip, as it is an area of
deep and drifting snow. The drifts may mean sections of heavy
trailbreaking even if another party has already broken out the
trail.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Mount Hale</h3>

<p>Mount Hale is usually climbed on the way the hut or on the way
back. Those reaching the hut from Crawford Notch can do Mt Hale
from the hut by the Lend a Hand Trail (rt: 5.4 miles; 1,300 feet;
3:20).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Mounts Tom and Field</h3>

<p>Similarly Mounts Tom and Field are often done as part of the
trip to the hut or back, but those reaching the hut from the
Zealand Road may want to do them from the hut. For either peak take
the A-Z Trail to the height of land. From there go either north on
the Mt Tom Spur Trail to the summit of Mount Tom, or south on the
Willey Range trail to the summit of Mount Field.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>Routes to Neighboring
Huts</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Routes to Galehead
Hut</h3>

<p>The Twinway goes from Zealand Hut to
<a href="galehead-hut.html">Galehead Hut</a> (ow: 7.0 miles; 2,850
feet; 4:55). There is a steep section climbing to Zeacliff, after
which the grades become much easier. The trail passes by the
viewless Zealand Mountain, the descends to a col before climbing up
Mount Guyot (a short steep section). This is followed by a long,
mainly gradual, climb to the summit of South Twin. The descent to
Galehead Hut is short and very steep.</p>

<p>There are 360&deg; views from the summits of South Twin and
Guyot, and excellent, though partial, views from Zeacliff.</p>

<p>Peakbaggers will get both South Twin and Zealand Mountain this
way. They can add North Twin for an additional 2.6 miles and 750
feet. Alternately, they can swing to the south and do West Bond and
Bond, adding 3.6 miles and 1,000 feet (including a steep climb up
Bond!). The really motivated can add Bondcliff to the trip, for a
total of 13 miles and 4,500 feet, with a book time of 8:45.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>Routes to Mizpah Hut</h3>

<p>The short route to <!--
<A HREF="mizpah-hut.html">Mizpah Hut</A> 
-->
Mizpah Hut is by the A-Z and Avalon Trails to Crawford Notch, then
by the Crawford Path and Mizpah Cutoff to the hut. Note that this
route has two climbs, one from Zealand Notch to the hight of land
between Mounts Tom and Field, then a second one from Crawford Notch
to Mizpah Hut (ow: 8.1 miles, 3,100 feet, 5:35). As noted in the
description of routes to the hut, Mounts Tom and/or Field can be
added to that trip.</p>

<p>The much longer alternative route follows the AT along the Ethan
Pond Trail to NH 302, then follows the Webster Cliff Trail to the
hut (ow: 13.8 miles, 3,450 feet, 8:40).</p>
