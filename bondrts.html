<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.16225789428327&lon=-71.53764724731445&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Bond</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=44.15278&amp;lon=-71.53167&amp;s=100&amp;layer=DRG25&amp;size=l&amp;u=0">
Topozone map</a> of this section of the White Mountains of New
Hampshire.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC operates two <a href="amc-huts.html">huts</a> and one
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsite</a> in or near this area. Fees are charged at all of them,
reservations are advised at the huts, but there are no reservations
at the campsites.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand Falls Hut</a> is located
near the junction of the Twinway and Zealand trails [ow: 2.8 miles,
650 feet, 1:45]. A longer approach is from Crawford Notch by the
Avalon and A-Z trails [ow: 5.5 miles, 2,000 feet, 3:45]. It is
often used by peakbaggers in conjunction with other huts for
multi-day traverses, since it is too close to the road to be of
much use alone in summer. Winter is another story, with the Zealand
Road closed Zealand Mountain becomes even more remote than Mounts
Carrigain or Isolation, and the hut helps break up long trips into
more manageable segments.</li>

<li>The <a href="galehead-hut.html">Galehead Hut</a> is located at
the junction of the Garfield Ridge and Twinway trails. It is
usually reached by the Gale River and Garfield Ridge trails [ow:
4.6 miles, 2,200 feet, 3:25]. It makes it relatively easy to
combine Mt. Galehead with either Mt. Garfield to the West, or the
Twins to the East. In addition it can be combined with other huts
for a multi-day traverse.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>The Guyot campsite is located off the Bondcliff trail in the
heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It can be reached by the
Zealand trail and the Twinway [ow: 7.7 miles, 2,850 feet, 5:15], by
the Wilderness and Bondcliff trails [ow: 11.2 miles, 3,600 feet,
7:25] or by the North Twin trail and the Twinway [ow: 6.6 miles,
3,600, 5:05]. It has a shelter plus 6 single platforms.<br />
Many of the approaches to the Bonds use the Guyot campsite, which
can also be used as part of multi-day traverses.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Bonds" id="Bonds"></a> The Bonds</h2>

<p>For me, the Bonds are the crown jewels of the White Mountain
National Forest.  They are the remotest peaks in the WMNF, and many of
those attempting the four thousand footers find them the most
challenging. Many others find their remoteness to be their greatest
charm, and the views are, to my mind, the best in the Whites. The only
man-made structures visible from the three summits (all are bare) are
the ski slopes at Loon and the summit structures on Washington.</p>

<p>There are a large number of ways of doing them. They can be done
as day trips, as backpacks, or as hut based trips. Furthermore, all
three can be done in one trip, or two trips may be done, one to
Bondcliff and the other to Bond and West Bond.</p>

<h3><a name="Bonds2Days" id="Bonds2Days"></a>Bonds as Two Day
Trips</h3>

<p>Doing Bondcliff from the Kanc (rt: 18.2 miles, 3,100 feet,
10:40) is very similar to doing Owl's Head, it is a long trip with
moderate elevation gain. The first 4.7 miles along the Lincoln
Woods and Wilderness trails are almost totally flat, with only 450
feet of elevation gain. On the way back this segment seems much
longer than it was in the morning! There is a fairly short steep
section on the Bondcliff trail after the third stream crossing.
There is a short ledge scramble before the trail emerges from the
trees.</p>

<p>Once Bondcliff has been done Bond and West Bond can be done as a
day trip, or <a href="bondrts.html#BondsHut">from one of the huts</a>. West
Bond and Bond are done as a day trip from Zealand road, by the
Zealand, Twinway, Bondcliff and West Bond Spur trails (rt: 17.4
miles, 4,150 feet, 10:45). This is a spectacular trip in good
weather, with good (but not 360&deg;) views from Zeacliff and
absolutely spectacular 360&deg; views from Guyot and both Bonds.
You get Zealand as an added bonus on this trip.</p>

<h3><a name="Bonds1Day" id="Bonds1Day"></a>Three Bonds in a
Day</h3>

<p>Very fit hikers can do all three in one day. The distance is
slightly less than that of a
<a href="presidential-traverse.html">Presi Traverse</a>, with
<i>much</i> less elevation gain. One approach is by the Wilderness
and Bondcliff trails (rt: 23.0 miles, 4,500 feet, 13:45). The
Wilderness trail is flat, straight and boring, and at the end of a
long day it seems to go on forever. Experienced bushwhackers often
bushwhack from West Bond to the Franconia Brook trail, it saves a
couple of miles plus the climb up Bond and Bondcliff on the return
trip but has its own difficulties. Another possible round trip is
from Zealand Road, Twinway and Bondcliff, this involves quite a bit
of uphill on the return trip (rt: 19.8 miles, 4,850 feet, 12:20).
You get Zealand as a bonus, plus additional great views from Guyot
and Zeacliff.</p>

<p>With two cars traverses are possible, though the car spot is
long. One way is by the Zealand, Twinway, Bondcliff and Wilderness
trails, picking up Zealand as a bonus (lp: 19.5 miles, 3,700 feet,
11:35), the reverse involves more elevation gain (lp: 19.5 miles,
4,550 feet, 12:00). A longer and more strenuous alternative is by
the North Twin trail to the Twinway, Bondcliff and Wilderness
trails (lp: 20.2 miles, 4,350 feet, 12:15), the reverse again
involves more elevation gain(lp: 20.2 miles, 5,000 feet,
12:35).</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to all three Bonds:</p>

<h3><a name="BondsBackp" id="BondsBackp"></a>The Bonds as a
Backpack</h3>

<p>Any of the above approaches can be used as the basis for either
a two or three day trip.</p>

<p>For the overnight version of the round trip from Lincoln Woods set
up camp a mile or two up the Bondcliff trail. You can do the peaks on
the first day, after setting up camp, or on the second day. If doing
them on the second day you can either break camp after the peaks, or
spend a second night camping.</p>

<p>All the other approaches involve camping (for one or two nights)
at Guyot campsite. It is very crowded on summer weekends, at that
time an early start is essential to guarantee a site. On the first
day go to the Guyot campsite and set up camp. If planning a two day
trip go to the Bonds (4.8 miles, 1,850 feet, 3:05). Return next
day. For a three day trip just go to Guyot on day one, do the Bonds
on day two, and go out on day three. One approach that only works
as a backpack is a Zealand, Bonds and Twins traverse. First go from
Zealand Road to Guyot campsite, over Zeacliff and Zealand (ow: 7.5
miles, 2,850 feet, 5:10), and set up camp. For an overnight do the
Bonds (4.8 miles, 1,400 feet, 3:05) that day, for a three day trip
do them next day. On the last day go back over Guyot to S Twin,
then out over N Twin (ow: 8.2 miles, 1,050 feet, 4:40). This is my
favorite way to do the Bonds as a backpack, you get views from
Zeacliff, Guyot, all three Bonds and both Twins. However you do the
trip, watching the setting sun from West Bond on a nice summer
night is an unforgettable experience.</p>

<h3><a name="BondsHut" id="BondsHut"></a>The Bonds from the
Huts</h3>

<p>The Bonds can be done from either
<a href="galehead-hut.html">Galehead</a> or
<a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand</a> Huts, or as a side trip
while doing a traverse between them. You can either do all three,
or just Bond and West Bond.</p>

<p>The trip from Zealand Hut is similar to the round trip from the
Zealand trail trailhead, except that the hut is 2.8 miles and 650
vertical feet from the road, so starting from the hut and returning
there saves a little over three hours of book time. All three Bonds
are 14.2 miles and 4,200 feet, with a book time of 9:10, while Bond
and West Bond are only 11.8 miles and 3,500 feet, with a book time
of 7:40. In both cases you get Zealand as a bonus.</p>

<p>The trip from Galehead Hut is spectacular in good weather, going
up the Twinway from the hut to S. Twin, then down over Guyot to
either Bond and West Bond, or over all three. The climb up to S.
Twin from the hut is very steep, the climb back from Guyot is much
easier. The round trip to Bond and West Bond is 9.2 miles with
2,950 feet of elevation gain, book time 6:05, while adding
Bondcliff makes it 11.6 miles with 3,600 feet of elevation gain
with a book time of 7:35.</p>

<p>Finally the Bonds may be done as part of a hut traverse, between
Galehead and Zealand huts. From Galehead hut one goes up to S.
Twin, then by the Twinway to Guyot, then over two or three of the
Bonds, and finally down the Twinway to Zealand hut, getting Zealand
in the process. Since the elevation of Galehead Hut is 3,780 feet
while that of Zealand Hut is only 2,630 feet, doing the trip from
Galehead involves 1,150 less feet of elevation gain (of course,
getting to Galehead hut in the first place involves an extra 1,150
feet, there is no free lunch here). Distances, elevation gains and
book times are in the table below.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Mount Zealand</h2>

<h3><a name="Zealand" id="Zealand"></a>Zealand</h3>

<p>Those hikers who approach the Bonds from Zealand Road get this
peak as an added bonus. For others it is a separate hike by the
Zealand trail and the Twinway (rt: 11.0 miles, 2,300 feet, 6:40).
Mt. Zealand itself is viewless, but the trail goes by the Zeacliff
outlook which has great views.</p>
