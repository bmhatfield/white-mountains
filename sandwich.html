<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=43.95482&lon=-71.38144&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Passaconaway</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="maps" id="maps"></a>Online Maps</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a

the Tripyramids</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="shelters" id="shelters"></a>Shelters</h2>

<p>There are no huts in this area, and the Wonalancet Outdoor
Club's <a href="http://www.wodc.org/shelters.htm">shelters</a> have
been entirely removed. The following is an official WMNF
announcement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As of this Friday, June 7, 2002, Camp Shehadi, Camp Rich, and
Camp Heermance will be entirely removed from the Sandwich Range
Wilderness Area. The only remaining structure will be an outhouse
at the former Camp Rich site near the junction of the Rollins and
Dicey's Mill Trails. No permanent shelter will be available within
the Sandwich Range Wilderness. In keeping with current backcountry
camping regulations for this Wilderness, camping will be allowed on
the hardened areas at the former Heermance and Rich sites, however
we will be in the process of revegetating the Shehadi site (at the
Kate Sleeper/Rollins Trails junction) to discourage camping at this
location.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Tripyramids" id="Tripyramids"></a>The Tripyramids</h2>

<p>The classic approach is from Waterville Valley by the <b>Mt.
Tripyramid Trail</b>, going up the North Slide and down the South
Slide (lp: 11.0 miles, 3,000 feet, 7:00). Many will find the North
Slide, with its steep rock slabs and exposure, unappealing at all
times. All should avoid it when wet or icy. Under those conditions
the going up by the <b>Scaur Ridge</b> and <b>Pine Bend Brook</b>
trails and down by the Mt. Tripyramid Trail (lp: 12.1 miles, 3,000
feet, 7:30) is safer.</p>

<p>They can also be approached from the Kanc, taking the
<b>Sabbaday Brook Trail</b> to the col between North and Middle
Tripyramid, then doing each (South Tripyramid is not on the list
because of an inadequate col) (rt: 11.4 miles, 3,200 feet, 7:20).
The grades are reasonable and the footing good along most of the
trail, but there is a very steep and very rough section leading up
to the ridge. There are many brook crossings, some may be difficult
at high water.</p>

<p>Another approach from the Kanc is to take the Pine Bend Brook
trail to the summit of North Tripyramid, then follow the Mt.
Tripyramid Trail to Middle Tripyramid, returning by the same route
(rt: 9.6 miles, 3,450 feet, 6:30). Like all trails on Mt.
Tripyramid it has rough and steep sections.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to the Tripyramids:</p>
<br />

<h2><a name="Whiteface" id="Whiteface"></a>Mount Whiteface</h2>

<p>The standard approach is by the <b>Blueberry Ledge Trail</b> to
the south summit ledges, then along the <b>Rollins Trail</b> to the
(unmarked) summit (rt: 8.4 miles, 2,900, 5:40). There are some
ledges that require scrambling, they are dangerous when wet or icy.
A second route from the south is the <b>Flat Mountain Pond</b> and
<b>McCrillis</b> trails (NOT the McCrillis <i>path</i>!) to the
south ledges, again following the Rollins trail to the summit (rt:
10.4 miles, 3,050 feet, 6:45). The bridge across the Whiteface
River on the Flat Mountain pond trail has been removed, the
crossing may be difficult at high water.</p>

<p>Mt. Whiteface can also be approached from the north by the
<b>Downes Brook</b>, <b>Kate Sleeper</b> and <b>Rollins</b> trails
(rt: 12.4 miles, 2,700 feet, 7:35). Turn left on the Rollins trail
for the true summit (no views), right for the south ledges with
good views to the south.</p>

<h2><a name="Sleeper" id="Sleeper"></a>East Sleeper</h2>

<p>For those interested in the <a href="ne-hundred-highest.html">NE
Hundred Highest</a> peaks, <b>East Sleeper</b> is easily combined with
Whiteface.  From the Rollins Trail south of the summit of Mount
Whiteface it is
1.7 miles (each
way) to the summit of East Sleeper, with about 400 feet of elevation
gain on the way to East Sleeper and about 500 feet on the way back.
This gives a total of 11.8 miles and 3,800 feet of elevation gain for
both peaks (book time 7:50).</p>

<p>East Sleeper adds only 0.8 miles from the junction of the Downes
Brook and Kate Sleeper trails for those coming from the Kanc, with 400
feet of elevation gain.  The total distance for both peaks is 14.0
miles with 3,100 feet (book time 8:35).</p>

<h2><a name="Passaconaway" id="Passaconaway"></a>Mount
Passaconaway</h2>

<p>In spite of the great number of trails on the southern slopes of
Mt. Passaconaway almost all peakbaggers coming from the south go up
<b>Dicey's Mill Trail</b> (rt: 9.2 miles, 2,950 feet, 6:05). The
trail has mostly easy grades and the footing is good.</p>

<p>Mt. Passaconaway can also be approached from the Kanc by the
<b>Oliverian Brook</b>, <b>Passaconaway Cutoff</b>, <b>Square
Ledge</b> and <b>Walden</b> trails (rt: 10.2 miles, 2,800 feet,
6:30).</p>

<h2><a name="WhitePass" id="WhitePass"></a>Mount Whiteface and
Mount Passaconaway</h2>

<p>A common way of doing both Mt. Whiteface and Mt. Passaconaway in
the same trip is to go up the Bluberry Ledges trail, then take the
<b>Rollins Trail</b> to its junction with the Dicey's Mill Trail.
The continue up Dicey's Mill Trail to the summit of Mt.
Passaconaway, and descend by that trail (lp: 11.9 miles; 3,800
feet; 7:50). Note that this involves 750 vertical feet going up
Mount Passaconnaway from the end of the Rollins Trail.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to Mount Whiteface and Mount
Passaconaway:</p>
