<h1>Mendon Peak, Trip Report</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">
This is a report on a trip that Mike and I made to
Mendon Peak in Vermont (a trailless peak on the
<a href="ne-hundred-highest.html">New England 100 Highest</a>
list). The notes on the 100 highest peaks describe many approaches
to that peak, we chose to follow the logging road that goes up the
Eddy Brook valley fairly high up before starting the bushwhack. 

<p>You will probably want to bring the real USGS Killington quad
with you on the trip, I am including a pointer to a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4830105&amp;e=672673&amp;s=25&amp;size=m">
Topozone map</a> of the area for your convenience while you read
the description.</p>

<p>We met at the Information booth at exit 28 in Campton, and drove
off to Vermont, stopping in Woodstock for an excellent breakfast.
We reached the Bucklin Trailhead around 9:30, and at 9:40 we were
hiking up the logging road that follows Eddy Brook. The road
crosses the brook three times (plus a tributary), the crossings
<i>should</i> all have been easy as they were shallow and the water
was flowing quite slowly. In spite of that the first crossing was
difficult, as there were few convenient stepping stones. I got one
foot completely immersed on the way in, Mike did the same on the
way out.</p>

<p>The road has a very sharp hairpin turn at around 3,080 feet,
marked by a cairn. I had gone up from there a few years ago, and
found the climb rather steep. So we continued on the road for an
additional 300 vertical feet, doing that steep section on the road
rather than through the woods. We reached that point at 11:20,
taking 1:40 to do the road walk. From there we followed a course
towards the east peak of Mendon (the real summit is on the west
peak).</p>

<p>The bushwhack fell into three clearly defined stages. First we
covered the rather flat area, which had wide open woods with a
wonderful carpet of wood sorrel, moss and ferns. The combination of
excellent footing, few blowdowns and open woods made that walk
easier than a trail walk! It took us 20 minutes to get to the place
where the terrain became steeper (base of the peaks).</p>

<p>Climbing to the east summit was much harder. The trees were very
dense and solid, and though we stumbled on a rudimentary herd path
the going was tough. It took us 20 minutes to climb the steep 200
feet to the summit, assuming that we reached the actual east
summit. The reason I am not sure that we reached the east summit is
that last time we had found an excellent trail between the two
summits, this time it was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>So we started bushwhacking across the short col between the two
summits, and eventually came across the connecting path. From there
it was easy going to the real summit (west) and to the cannister.
It took us 20 minutes to get from one summit to the other, for a
total time of one hour bushwhacking. There were hundreds of flies
at the summit, and no good rocks or trees to sit on, so we decided
to have lunch later.</p>

<p>The start of the return trip was much easier. The path that we
had found took us back to the east summit and down through the
first 100 feet of dense growth with little difficulty. The lower
100 feet of steep and dense terrain were a bit harder, but quite
manageable, then the flat part was as easy as it had been on the
way in. It took us 40 minutes from the west peak back to the
road.</p>

<p>The trip down the road was uneventful, we stopped for a 15
minute lunch at the first (highest) stream crossing, and reached
the car in 1:35 (including lunch stop), for almost exactly five
hours total time. An excellent dinner at the Italian Farmhouse in
Plymouth was a fitting finish to a wonderful day!</p>
