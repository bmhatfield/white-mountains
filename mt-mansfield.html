<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>You may want to look (in a separate window) at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=44.54361&amp;lon=-72.81472&amp;loc=Mount+Mansfield">
Topozone Map</a> of the Mount Mansfield area.</p>

<p>Mount Mansfield (elevation 4,393 feet) is the highest mountain
in Vermont. From the east its ridge resembles the profile of a
human face, and the names of its prominent features reflect this:
Adams Apple (4,060'), Chin (4,393', highest point), Nose (4,062')
and Forehead (3,940'). For about 2.3 miles (from the Forehead to
Adams Apple) the Long Trail is almost constantly above treeline,
the only such long stretch of alpine zone in Vermont. Please stay
on the trail to avoid harming the delicate vegetation! As the
<i>Long Trail Guide</i> writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mount Mansfield is the most frequently visited mountain in
Vermont with nearly 40,000 visitors walking its upper reaches every
year. This use has severely affected its fragile
ecosystem.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are very many trails up Mt. Mansfield, I will describe a
few of the more popular routes. Many of the routes that are not
described here are very steep and exposed. The most used routes
approach it from the east, but the routes from the west are perhaps
more interesting.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The National Weather Service in Burlington, VT, has a forecast for
<a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/">the Higher Summits
of Vermont and Northern New York</a> as well as a point
forecast for <a
href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/point/MANSFIELD.txt">Mount Mansfield</a>.</p>

<h2>Mount Mansfield from the east</h2>

<h3>Long Trail from Smuggler's Notch</h3>

<p>The classic loop goes up by the Long Trail from Smuggler's Notch
(on VT 108, east of the mountain), past Taft Lodge, to the col
(Eagle Pass) between the Chin and the Nose. There is a section with
steep ledges between the Chin and Eagle Pass, I prefer to go up it
than down! Follow the ridge for about 2 miles to the Summit Station
at the base of the Nose. Descend a short distance on the Toll Road,
then take the <b>Haselton Trail</b> to the base of the mountain on
VT 108, about a mile south of where you started (lp: 6.5 miles;
2,800 feet; 4:40). Note that the entire ridge is very exposed to
the elements.</p>

<p>In bad weather it is much preferable to avoid the loop and just
go up and back on the Long Trail (rt: 4.6 miles; 2,800 feet; 3:40).
The amount of exposure can be further reduced by going from Taft
Lodge to the Chin by the very steep, but sheltered, <b>Profanity
Trail</b> (same distance and elevation gain).</p>

<h3>Hell Brook Trail</h3>

<p>A much steeper and rougher approach from the north is by the
<b>Hell Brook Trail</b>. This trail meets the LT in Eagle Pass, 0.3
mile north of the summit. It is recommended to descend by the LT
(lp: 4.1 miles; 2,600 feet; 3:20).</p>

<h2>Mount Mansfield from the west</h2>

<h3>Sunset Ridge Trail</h3>

<p>Another popular approach is from Underhill State Park to the
west of the mountain. The scenic route is the <b>Sunset Ridge
Trail</b>, which follows the Sunset Ridge above treeline for almost
a mile (rt: 6.6 miles; 2,700 feet; 4:40). You can make a loop back
to the same trailhead by following the <b>Laura Cowles Trail</b>
(6.0 miles; 2,700 feet; 4:20). For my spring of 2003 trip to
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/mount-mansfield.html">Adam's
Apple on Mount Mansfield</a> I used the Sunset Ridge Trail. <!--
