This description of my 2001 attempt at a Presi Traverse is a
supplement to the discussion in the
<a href="presidential-traverse.html">Presi Traverse FAQ</a>. I hope
it will make the issues discussed there come to life. 

<h2><a name="Training" id="Training"></a><a name="tocref1"
id="tocref1"></a>Training</h2>

<p>I try to hike two or three days a week, both in the
<a href="strenuous.html">Boston area</a> and in the White
Mountains. I try to do one strenuous hike each week, either a long
hike, or one with substantial elevation gain, or a shorter hike
done fast (relative to my usual times!). I use my altimeter
constantly when hiking, computing average rate of elevation gain
(feet per hour), which I find to be a better indicator than speed
(miles per hour).</p>

<p>The traverse was scheduled for around June 20<sup>th</sup>
(subject to weather forecasts, we did it on the 25<sup>th</sup>),
and in early June I started pushing myself harder:</p>

<ul>

<li><i>June 6<sup>th</sup></i>. I did the
<a href="bondrts.html#Bonds">Three Bonds in a Day</a> traverse from
Zealand to Lincoln Woods as part of a group. This is about 20 miles
with under 4,000 feet of elevation gain, it was mainly a test of
long distance stamina.</li>

<li><i>June 11<sup>th</sup></i>. This and the next two hikes, all
in the Northern Presis, were done solo. This time I went up the
Valley Way to the hut, then up to Madison and back to the hut, then
on to Adams and down by Lowe's Path and connecting trails to
Appalachia.</li>

<li><i>June 14<sup>th</sup></i>. Back up to Madison Hut by the
Valley Way, then along the Gulfside Trail to the Israel Ridge
trail, which I followed down to the Perch, back by Randolph Path
and connecting trails.</li>

<li><i>June 17<sup>th</sup></i>. This time I climbed Madison by
Howker Ridge, and descended from the hut by the Valley
Way.</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose to do three hikes in the Northern Presis because I have
always had difficulty going down the piles of rock that are so
frequent in that area. Clearly practice led to some improvement,
but it was clear that I would slow down significantly on several
sections.</p>

<p>After the 17<sup>th</sup> I stopped doing anything strenuous
until the traverse, to allow my body to recover from what had
clearly been excessive training. For me four big hikes over twelve
days is definitely pushing it!</p>

<h2><a name="Logistics" id="Logistics"></a><a name="tocref2"
id="tocref2"></a>Logistics</h2>

<p>Chris asked me to join a group of his friends on a traverse,
they did most of the planning. Chris and I met at Crawford on
Sunday PM, the day before the traverse. We left my car there, and
drove to Gorham. We had been thinking of staying in the bunk room
at the <a href="http://www.hikersparadise.com/">Hiker's
Paradise</a>, but since we wanted to go to sleep early and wake at
the crack of dawn we decided to stay in their motel rooms. We asked
when the neighboring convenience store opened in the morning, and
to our delight were told that it was a 24 hour store.</p>

<p>We woke a bit before 4 AM, got coffee at the convenience store,
ate some bagels and muffins, and drove to the trailhead, ready to
hike at 4:45. Sleeping 15 minutes from the trailhead is a
<i>big</i> win!</p>

<h2><a name="Gear" id="Gear"></a><a name="tocref3"
id="tocref3"></a>Food and Gear</h2>

<p>We had decided that we were not going to eat at the summit of
Mt. Washington, as experience has shown that this can consume too
much time. So in addition to snacks (lots of gorp, one apple, candy
for instant sugar) I brought a couple of bagels and most of a stick
of cheddar.</p>

<p>I brought three quart water bottles. Since Madison Hut is less
than four miles from the trailhead I only filled one before
starting, refilling it and filling the other two there. This saved
about four pounds on the climb to the hut, which is about 40% of
the total elevation gain. The three litres lasted comfortably until
Lakes, where we refilled again. I drank about four liters on the
entire trip, others drank closer to six liters.</p>

<p>I used my heavy <a href="http://www.limmerboot.com/">Limmer
boots</a>. Many people prefer to use something lighter for such a
long day, but I feel that I need the sturdiest boots I own for the
rough terrain. This is very much a matter of personal opinion.</p>

<p>I always pack for the worst possible weather when planning a
trip with a lot of time above treeline. So I packed polypro top and
bottom, fleece gloves, hat and jacket, Goretex top and bottom, and
a light weight wind jacket.</p>
