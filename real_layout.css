/* Here is the ugly brilliant hack that protects IE5/Win from its own
stupidity.  Thanks to Tantek Celik for the hack and to Eric Costello
for publicizing it.  IE5/Win incorrectly parses the "\"}"" value,
prematurely closing the style declaration. The incorrect IE5/Win value
is above, while the correct value is below. See
http://glish.com/css/hacks.asp for details. */

/* I've heard this called the "be nice to Opera 5" rule. Basically, it
feeds correct length values to user agents that exhibit the parsing
error exploited above yet get the CSS box model right and understand
the CSS2 parent-child selector. ALWAYS include a "be nice to Opera 5"
rule every time you use the Tantek Celik hack (above). */
