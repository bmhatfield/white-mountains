<h1>Trailwrights 72 and 4000 Footer Committee 48 Lists Compared</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">


<p>Judging from postings on the hiking bulletin boards, the
<a href="trailwrights-72.html">Trailwrights list</a> of 72 peaks is
beginning to attract larger numbers of peakbaggers.</p>

<p>The traditional lists have no restrictions on how many peaks may
be done on a single trip. The
<a href="http://www.trailwrights.org/">Trailwrights</a> (a trail
maintaining organization) have a different set of rules for the NH
4,000 footers: only one peak may be claimed on one hike. In
addition, they recognize a peak if the col between it and its
higher neighbors is over 100 feet, which leads to a much longer
list, with 72 peaks. Their final requirement is that you do 72
hours of trail work.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb for bagging peaks the traditional way
is that you can average one and a half peaks a day, as some of the
peaks are clearly isolated (Mount Moosilauke for example) while
others equally clearly come in pairs (the Kinsmans are an example).
So the 48 peaks on the 4000 Footer Club list can be done in 30 to
35 days of hiking. Doing the Trailwrights list essentially doubles
the time commitment.</p>

<p>For example, peakbaggers doing the standard 4000 Footer
Committee list usually do the three Carters (Carter Dome, Middle
and South Carter) on that list in one or two trips. Doing it the
Trailwrights way requires six trips; one for each of the three
standard peaks, plus one for each of the added peaks (Mounts Hight,
Lethe and North Carter). This is not for those who want to see how
fast the can finish a list; it is for those who want to savor the
mountains!</p>

<h2>The Extra Peaks</h2>

<p>I will say a few words about each of the extra peaks, enough to
give the person contemplating the list a good idea of what is
involved. There are five real bushwhacks on the list: Mount Blue,
Southwest Twin, Northwest Hancock, and West and Middle Osceola.
Mount Lethe, North Isolation and Mount Jim are slightly off the
trail in the woods, and while there are no trails to the minor
Adams peaks they are close to the trail and above treeline.</p>

<p>Note that the Trailwrights list is not updated when new maps are
published, so they still list the "E" peak of the Mount Wildcat
rather than the slightly higher "D" peak. However, for some reason,
Middle Hancock was dropped as of January 1<sup>st</sup> 2004 and
replaced with Northwest Hancock.</p>

<h3>Mount Moosilauke</h3>

<p>The Trailwrights list had three additional peaks on the Mount
Moosilauke massif:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <b>South Peak</b> is reached by a short trail from the
junction of the Glencliff Trail and the Carriage Road. It is a bare
summit, and has excellent views, different enough from those on the
main summit to make a very worthwhile destination, even for those
not doing the list.</li>

<li><b>Mount Jim</b> is a small gentle bump on the Asquam Ridge
Trail. The "summit" itself is a few feet north of the trail, there
is a very clear herd path from the highest point of the trail. It
is completely in the trees, but is on the often done Gorge
Brook-Asquam Ridge loop.</li>

<li><b>Mount Blue</b> is a short but often nasty bushwhack of about
.2 miles from the Beaver Brook Trail. Eminently forgettable, a peak
that only a peakbagger would visit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Franconia Ridge</h3>

<p>Most peakbaggers get the four peaks on Franconia Ridge in two
trips; one over the Flume and Mount Liberty, the other over Little
Haystack and Mounts Lincoln and Lafayette. Not only do those
following the Trailwrights rules have to do them on separate trips,
but there are two additional peaks, leading to six trips to the
ridge.</p>

<ul>

<li>Though <b>Little Haystack</b> does not count for the 4000
footer Committee it does for the Trailwrights. I like to treat it
as a worthy destination by and of itself, rather than as a mere
rest stop on the classic loop.</li>

<li><b>North Lincoln</b> is a bulge along the ridge between Mounts
Lincoln and Lafayette. I see it as little more than an excuse to go
up to the ridge one more time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Waterville Valley</h3>

<p>The list adds two more subpeaks of Mount Osceola and the third
of the Tripyramids:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>West Osceola</b>, which is usually reached by a bushwhack
from the hight of land on the East Pond Trail.</li>

<li><b>Middle Osceola</b>, usually reached by a bushwhack from the
Mount Osceola Trail a bit before the summit.</li>

<li><b>South Tripyramid</b>, the lowest of the three. It is often
done as part of the classic loop up the North Slide and down the
South Slide (the North Slide may be avoided by those who are
uncomfortable in exposed areas by going up the Scaur Ridge and Pine
Bend Brook trails).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Hancocks</h3>

<p>There is a small bump between North and South Hancock, named
appropriately enough <b>Middle Hancock</b>, that used to be on the
list. It has been replaced by <b>Northwest Hancock</b>, a peak that
was formerly on the New England 100 Highest list. The usual approach
at that time was by the Cedar Brook Trail, leaving that trail up a
strem known informally as Slide Brook. That stream leads to a slide
that reaches the ridge a little <i>south</i> of the col between North
and Northwest Hancock, you therefore have to go down to the col before
ascending.</p>

<h3>The Twins-Bonds Ridge</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Mount Guyot</b>, which does not count for the 4000 Footer
Club, is on the Trailwrights list. Many people do the entire ridge
in a single day, for the Trailwrights you must visit it six time.
Since it is my favorite area in the White Mountains I, for one, do
not complain.</li>

<li>An addition peak is <b>Southwest Twin</b>, on the ridge south
of the Twin Brook Trail. It may be approached by bushwhacking
either from that trail or from the Franconia Brook Trail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Wildcats and Carters</h3>

<p>This is an area where the Trailwrights require many more trips
than the standard peakbagger will do. In addition to the "one peak
per trip" rule we have three extra peaks along the Carter-Moriah
Trail, plus one extra one on the Wildcat Ridge. No fewer than nine
trips are needed to complete these two ranges, the average
peakbagger does them in three trips.</p>

<ul>

<li>The Trailwrights list does not get revised when newer maps are
published, so it still recognizes <b>Wildcat E</b>, rather than
Wildcat D, as the second highest peak of that range. The two peaks
are quite close together, and in any case those doing a traverse
will get both.</li>

<li>In addition the list recognizes <b>Wildcat C</b>. Again, since
almost all hikers do both the A and D peaks on the same trip, it
gets done automatically.</li>

<li>The list recognizes <b>Mount Height</b>, which has much better
views that Carter Dome.</li>

<li>Another minor peak on the list is <b>Mount Lethe</b>, a bump
off the Carter Moriah Trail between South and Middle Carter. Most
traditional peakbaggers do not visit that bump.</li>

<li>Finally there is <b>North Carter</b>, another peak that fails
the 4000 Footer Club's 200 foot rule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Presidential Range (southern part)</h3>

<p>The Trailwrights add four peaks in the southern part of the
presidential range. None of them (with the possible exception of
Boott Spur) is very interesting as a destination, but they are all
in areas with great views.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Mount Franklin</b> is a tiny bump on the ridge between
Mounts Eisenhower and Monroe, reached by a spur off the main
Crawford Path.</li>

<li>The <i>White Mountain Guide</i> describes <b>Slide Peak</b> as
"the rather insignificant peak heading the Gulf of Slides". It is
insignificant as a peak, but the trail that leads to it (the Glen
Boulder Trail) is well worth the trip.</li>

<li><b>Boott Spur</b> is a wonderful little summit at the end of
the ridge that separates the Gulf of Slides from Tuckerman's
Ravine. It is often visited as part of the Boott Spur Tuckerman's
Ravine loop up Mount Washington.</li>

<li><b>North Isolation</b> is just off the Davis Path, a little bit
north of its junction with the Isolation Trail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Presidential Range (northern part)</h3>

<p>There are five extra peaks in the northern part of the
presidential range. While Mount Clay is probably the only one that
is a worth while destination, the others offer an excellent excuse
to return to that wonderful area.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Mount Clay</b> is not often visited, which is a pity since
it has excellent views into the Great Gulf. It may be done alone (a
very worthwhile hike) or combined with Mount Washington or Mount
Jefferson. Mount Clay has two small bumps, according to the
Washburn map the northern one is the true summit, but most people
will do them both since the trail goes over both of them.</li>

<li><b>Adams 5</b> is a small peak off the Gulfside Trail between
Mount Adams and Edmands Col, close to the junction with the Israel
Ridge Path.</li>

<li><b>Sam Adams</b> is a small peak south of Thunderstorm
Junction. It is a "real" peak, unlike the rest of the minor members
of the Adams family.</li>

<li><b>John Quincy Adams</b> is the small peak on the ridge above
the Airline Trail, it has two small summits, I am not sure which is
the true summit.</li>

<li><b>Adams 4</b> is an utterly insignificant pile of rocks along
Lowe's Path, again we have two piles, climb them both!</li>
</ul>
