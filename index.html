<h1>Peakbagging the 4000 Footer Mountains of New England</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>Over the years the same questions keep coming up on the various
bulletin boards that discuss hiking and peakbagging in the White
Mountains of New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont:</p>

<ul>

<li>What is the easiest way up Mt. Washington?</li>

<li>What is the best way of getting to Mt. Isolation?</li>

<li>How does one get to the Bonds?</li>

<li>What are the easiest 4,000 footers in the Whites?</li>

<li>Where can I find the AMC 4000 Footer Club lists of
peaks?</li>
</ul>


<p>This site attempts to answer these questions. It offers a
detailed discussion of the routes to the 4000 footers of the White
Mountains in New Hampshire and the Green Mountains of Vermont,
together with general information that seems useful.  Here is
the structure of the site:</p>

<h2>Routes to the Peaks</h2>

<p>The <a href="nhnotes.html">Routes to the Peaks</a> section
discusses briefly the basis on which routes were selected, and
leads to the main body of this site, the hiking routes to the peaks
(see list of pages in panel). For every route described I give the
distance, elevation gain and book time, for many peaks there is
also a table comparing these statistics for the various routes.</p>

<h2>Peakbagging and Lists</h2>

<p>This section discusses <a href="bagging.html">Peak Bagging in New
England</a>, together with some notes on New York. It begins with a
historical introduction, and goes on to describe the various lists of
peaks that people bag. There is the <a href="nh-4000-footers.html">New
Hampshire 4000 Footer List</a> (White Mountains 4,000 footer list to
give it its official name), the <a href="ne-4000-footers.html">New
England (Maine and Vermont) 4000 Footer List</a> and the <a
href="ne-hundred-highest.html">NE Hundred Highest Peaks List</a>,
together with some information on the <a
href="completers.html">numbers of hikers</a> completing each list.</p>

<p>The <a href="lists.html">Index of Lists</a> also has pointers to
Excel spreadsheets that you can download and use to record your
progress in bagging the peaks. Once you have bagged them all, the
spreadsheet may be used as an application to the <a
href="4000-footer-club.html">4000 Footer Club</a>.</p>

<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>The <a href="general.html">General Information</a> section
includes a list of guidebooks, maps, web resources of general use
to hikers, and some <i>very</i> brief notes on safety. The closely
related <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> (list of Frequently Asked
Questions) answers questions that did not fit into the General
Information section, and includes a section on doing a
<a href="presidential-traverse.html">one day presidential
traverse</a>. The <a href="links.html">Links</a> section has links
to sites I have found useful but that did not fit into the more
narrative sections.</p>

<h2>AMC Huts</h2>

<p>The AMC has built a chain of 8 <a href="amc-huts.html">huts</a>,
located a day's hike apart along the Appalachian Trail, which offer
comfortable accommodations with bunk beds and hearty, family-style
meals.</p>

<p>All of the New Hampshire 4,000 footers can be hiked in a single
day, but many hikers prefer to spend a night at one of the huts
when doing some of the remoter peaks, and others just go to the
huts as a destination.</p>

<h2>Articles and Adventures</h2>

<p>I have added some <a href="articles.html">articles</a> that I
have written over the years. Most deal with hiking in New England.
I have also added accounts of various
<a href="adventures.html">adventures</a>, the latter being either
unusually long hikes, or hikes where something "interesting"
happened.</p>
