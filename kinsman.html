<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.12266&lon=-71.73533&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">South
Kinsman</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="maps" id="maps"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
Topozone map of the
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4891664&amp;e=283311&amp;s=100&amp;layer=DRG25&amp;size=l&amp;u=0">
Kinsman Ridge</a> while reading the text.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Hut and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The four summits in this area are normally done as dayhikes, the
shelters here are mainly for AT hikers and the hut for
families.</p>

<p>The AMC operates one <a href="amc-huts.html">hut</a> and two
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsites</a> in this area. Fees are charged at the hut and the
Kinsman Pond shelter, reservations are advised at the hut, but
there are no reservations at the campsites.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="lonesome-lake-hut.html">Lonesome Lake Hut</a> is
most easily reached by the Lonesome Lake and Cascade Brook trails
(ow: 1.6 miles, 950 feet, 1:15). Because of its short distance from
the road and its lakeside location it is a favorite of families
with young children, it is not of much interest to serious
hikers.</li>

<li>The Kinsman Pond campsite is at the junction of the Fishin'
Jimmy and Kinsman Pond trails (ow: 3.5 miles, 2,150 feet, 2:50).
There is a shelter and three tentsites. While the Kinsmans are
usually done as a dayhike it would certainly be possible to do them
(and perhaps Cannon) as an overnight using this campsite.</li>

<li>The Eliza Brook shelter is on the Kinsman Ridge trail near the
crossing of the brook. It is of no interest to
peakbaggers.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref1a" id="tocref1a"></a>Franconia Notch
Recreational Trail (Bike Path)</h2>

<p>The bike path (maintained by the New Hampshire Division of Parks
and Recreation) connects many of the trailheads in Franconia Notch,
and is useful when making loops with only one car. The following
table gives the cumulative distances (in both directions) and
elevations of several locations on the path.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Kinsman Ridge</h2>

<h3><a name="Kinsmans" id="Kinsmans"></a>Mount Kinsman</h3>

<p>I will only describe routes to both peaks of Mt. Kinsman, since
the only practical way to reach South Kinsman is over North
Kinsman. So if you do North Kinsman alone on one trip, you will
have to go over it again when doing South Kinsman. The most common
route up the Kinsmans is by the <b>Lonesome Lake</b>, <b>Cascade
Brook</b>, <b>Fishin' Jimmy</b> and <b>Kinsman Ridge</b> trails
(rt: 10.0 miles, 3,550 feet, 6:45). Another approach from Franconia
Notch is from the Basin by the <b>Basin Cascades</b>, <b>Cascade
Brook</b>, <b>Kinsman Pond</b> and <b>Kinsman Ridge</b> trails (rt:
11.0 miles, 3,450 feet, 7:15). The Kinsman Pond trail is very
rough, and in places very wet.</p>

<p>They may also be approached from the west by taking the <b>Mt.
Kinsman Trail</b> to the <b>Kinsman Ridge Trail</b> (10.0 miles,
3,900 feet, 7:00), this is the approach recommend by Dan Doan in
his <i>Fifty Hikes in the White Mountains</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="Cannon" id="Cannon"></a>Cannon Mountain</h3>

<p>All three routes up Cannon are short, but they are also steep
and rough. One approach is by the <b>Lonesome Lake</b> and
<b>Kinsman Ridge</b> trails (rt: 6.2 miles, 2,300 feet, 4:15). A
second approach is by the <b>Lonesome Lake</b>, <b>High Cannon</b>
and <b>Kinsman Ridge</b> trails (rt: 5.6 miles, 2,300 feet, 3:55).
The third approach is from the Tramway parking lot by the
<b>Kinsman Ridge Trail</b> (rt: 4.0 miles, 2,100 feet, 3:15).</p>

<h3><a name="Cannonball" id="Cannonball"></a>Northeast Cannonball</h3>

<p>The Northeast Cannonball is a small prominence on the Kinsman Ridge
that rises high enough to be included on the <a
href="ne-hundred-highest.html">NE Hundred Highest</a> peaks list.  It
lies about 0.2 miles south of Coppermine Col (junction of Lonesome
Lake and Kinsman Ridge trails), about 340 feet above the col.  If done
in conjunction with Cannon Mountain it will add about 20 minutes to
the trip.  Though the added section is short, it is steep and
rocky.</p>

<p>It may also be done alone, by the Lonesome Lake and Kinsman Ridge
trails (rt: 5.0 miles; 2,000 feet; 3:30).</p>


<h3>Mount Kinsman and Cannon Mountain</h3>

<p>It is possible to combine the Kinsmans and Cannon in a long
trip. The easiest way is probably up the Lonesome Lake, Fishin'
Jimmy and Kinsman Ridge trails to North Kinsman, then out to South
Kinsman and back, and then go northwards on the Kinsman Ridge Trail
to Cannon, returning by the Kinsman Ridge and Lonesome Lake trails
(lp: 13.0 miles, 4,700 feet, 8:50). The going along the Kinsman
Ridge Trail is very rough, this trip is considerably more strenuous
than the numbers might indicate. In addition to the Kinsmans and
Cannon you get to bag the Northeast Cannonball (see above for other
routes).</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to the Kinsman Ridge
peaks:</p>
