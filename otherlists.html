<p>If you spend much time with hikers you will probably have heard
of the <a href="4000-footer-club.html">AMC 4,000 Footer Club</a>
and its <a href="lists.html">lists of peaks</a>. Let me introduce
you to a few lists that are much less well known, and that you may
find of interest.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Trailwrights List</h2>

<p>Gene Daniel, in a posting, explains the genesis of the
Trailwrights approach:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In any case, so far as the Trailwrights 72 Summits list is
concerned, it was invented by Hal Graham because he wanted to have
an excuse to make more hikes to summits above 4000 feet in New
Hampshire - some old ones (e.g. the Carters, 6 peaks in all) and
some new ones (Southwest Twin, West Osceola, etc.). He invented a
game that fulfilled his particular interests and there are others
who found it intriguing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Many peakbaggers want to finish lists as fast as they can, and
so often combine two or more peaks in a single trip. Hal Graham
wanted the opposite, to spend as much time as he could hiking. So
he added a rule, and modified the list.</p>

<p>His new rule was that you could only count <i>one</i> peak per
trip. He also added <a href="trailwrights.html">24 new peaks</a> to
the list that, while over 4,000 feet, did not meet the 4000 Footer
Club's criterion of having a col at least 200 feet deep between a
peak and its higher neighbor. It is not clear exactly what
criterion he used, it seems to be 100 feet of col in general, with
a less restrictive requirement for named "peaks" (some of which are
more knobs than peaks!).</p>

<p>Almost by definition this list does not take you far afield, as
all the added peaks are close to peaks on the original 4,000 Footer
Club list. If you wish to climb in new areas, check the other
lists.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Eric Savage's T3000
List</h2>

<p>Eric Savage has put together a <a href="nh_t3000.html">list</a> of
peaks which are above 3,000 feet <i>and have trails to them (hence the
"T" in "T3000")</i>.  His criteria for inclusion on the list are:</p>

<ul>

<li>The elevation is greater than or equal to 3000 feet</li>

<li>The peak is reached (or very nearly reached) by a reasonable
trail or herd path or is easily accessible via a spur path, open
ledges, etc.</li>

<li>The peak rises 100 feet above the ridge connecting it to a
higher neighbor OR rises 40 feet and has an official or generally
accepted name</li>
</ul>

<p>I have never heard anyone talk of it, but find it fascinating.
It goes beyond the 4,000 footers, and does not require any
bushwhacking. A great way to meet new hiking areas!</p>

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>County Highpoints</h2>

<p>Highpointers aim to reach the highest point of a group of
geographic entities (countries, states, counties, you get the idea)
by any means. The best known group in the United States is the
State Highpointers Club, whose members aim to reach the highest
point of each of the fifty states. Some of these highpoints are
impressive mountains (Denali, Rainier, Whitney) while others are in
the middle of corn fields in the mid-West.</p>

<p>County highpointers have a variety of goals. Amongst the
commonest goals are either the absolute number of county
highpoints, or completing all the counties in one or more states.
My
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/highpointing-my-way.html">
goal</a> is to use these lists to add variety to my hiking diet,
with no great motivation to reach any specific quantitative goal. I
am presenting them to you in that spirit.</p>

<p>The lists for each state are available on the
<a href="http://www.cohp.org">County Highpointers</a> site. As you
scroll down you will see a map of the USA, click on any county (or
on its name if the name is off the map) and it will take you to a
page that lists the highpoints of that state and gives one or more
trip reports for each. A wonderful resource!!</p>

<p>I have a new site devoted to my
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/">highpointing
adventures</a>, and there is a section on my
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/county-highpoints.html">county
highpoints</a>, with descriptions (sometimes rather brief, at other
times much longer) of those I have visited. I suggest that you
spend some time exploring the lists, and see if you feel they might
add to your hiking fun.</p>

<p>One of my most enjoyable short hiking trips was a four day
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/berkshires.html">highpointing
trip to the Berkshires</a>. Crossing over into neighboring New York
I did three county highpoints, peaks that I had never heard of
before. The weather was good, all had great views and all in all it
was a wonderful trip. I would never have thought of visiting the
area had I not looked at the county highpointing site.</p>

<p>One interesting thing that I noted is that different states show
very different relations between the
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/peakbagging-highpointing.html">
peakbagging and highpointing</a> lists. In New Hampshire the 48
4,000 footers only give you two county highpoints, while in Vermont
the five 4,000 footers give you four county highpoints!</p>

<h2><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Most Prominent Peaks</h2>

<p>The prominence of a peak is the height to which it rises above
the highest col connecting it to a higher neighbor. Peakbagging
lists utilize prominence to differentiate between "a true peak" and
"an insignificant bump". But having established that a given
mountain is a true peak peakbagging lists rank solely by its
elevation. The prominence lists, on the other hand, use prominence
as their criterion for ranking peaks.</p>

<p>For a good discussion of prominence, with pointers to a variety
of lists, see the
<a href="http://www.cohp.org/prominence/index.htm">prominence
page</a> on the county highpointers site. On this site you will
find a list of the <a href="Prominence.html">fifty most prominent
peaks in New England</a>. The fans of prominence like to call such
lists "Fifty Finest", I find that an acceptably unidimensional view
of what a "fine mountain" is.</p>

<p>One problem with the county highpoints lists is that in a flat
county the highpoint will, not surprisingly, be a flat and
uninteresting area. On the other hand a prominent peak, by
definition, rises high above its surroundings.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Least Prominent Peaks</h2>

<p>A frequent contributor to the VTFF bulletin board, who posts
under the name of "stopher", has produced a list of the
<i>least</i> prominent peaks in the White Mountains, check it out
at <a href="http://www.lpnp.peakviews.com/">New Hampshire Least
Prominent Named Peaks</a>. I suspect that the list is intended as a
spoof on the many "serious" lists floating around, but he may well
be serious. Some of the peaks on it are quite interesting, for the
lover of arcane pieces of information, Ball Crag is the other
<i>named</i> 6,000 footer in the Northeast!</p>

<h2><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>More Lists</h2>

<p>For the sake of completeness I will list here any other lists
that I find, with minimal comments. If I learn more about any of
these lists it may end up getting a section of its own!</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.nhmountainhiking.com/hike/lists/52view.html">52
With a View</a>, a list of peaks below 4,000 feet with good views.</p>



<li><p><a href="y-alpine-100.html">YMCA Alpine Club 100 Highest List</a>,
100 highest peaks in New Hampshire with a trail to the summit.  It is
not clear what criterion has been used to include peaks; it is clearly
<i>not</i> prominence since many of the peaks on that list
(e. g. Clay, Boot Spur, Slide Peak) are nowhere near the conventional
200 foot cutoff point, while similar peaks (e. g. Franklin, North
Lincoln) are not.</p></li>

<li><p>A delightful list of lesser peaks is the list of <a
href="http://www.belknapsportsmensclub.com/check_off_list.htm">twelve
peaks in the Belknap Range</a>, for which there is a <a
href="http://www.belknapsportsmensclub.com/hiking.php">patch</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>For those interested in firetowers there are lists of peaks
both in <a
href="http://www.dred.state.nh.us/divisions/forestandlands/bureaus/forestprotection/documents/CompletebrochureQuest.pdf">
New Hampshire</a> and in the <a
href="http://www.adk-gfs.org/fire_tower_challenge.html">Adirondacks</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Though it is not a list, and does not involve peakbagging, I would
like to mention the <a
href="http://www.whitemountainlosttrails.com/">White Mountain Lost
Trails Project</a>.  I, for one, greatly enjoy exploring off the
beaten path.</p></li>
