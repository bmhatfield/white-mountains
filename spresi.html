<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The best forecast for Mounts Monroe and Eisenhower is probably the
Mount Wasington Observatory's <a
href="http://www.mountwashington.org/weather/summit_forecast.php">Higher
Summits Forecast</a>. For Mounts Pierce and Jackson you might consult the <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A>, which gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). 
There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.2206&lon=-71.3701&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Pierce</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Map</h2>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC operates two <a href="amc-huts.html">huts</a> and two
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsites</a> in this area. Fees are charged at all of them,
reservations are advised at the huts, but there are no reservations
at the campsites.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="lakes-of-the-clouds-hut.html">Lakes of the Clouds
Hut</a> is located at the end of the Ammonoosuc Ravine trail [ow:
3.1 miles, 2,500 feet, 2:50]. It allows a relatively easy two day
trip to both <a href="spresi.html#Washhut">Washington and Monroe</a>. It may
also be used as part of a three day (two nights)
<a href="hut-traverse.html">Presidential traverse</a>, spending the
other night at Madison Spring Hut.</li>

<li>The <a href="mizpah-hut.html">Mizpah Spring Hut</a> is located
between Mts. Pierce and Jackson, and is reached by the Crawford
Path and the Mizpah cutoff [ow: 2.6 miles, 1,900 feet, 2:15]. It
seems too close to the road to be of much use for peakbaggers, but
is sometimes used, together with Lakes and Madison Huts, for a four
day traverse.</li>

<li>The Nauman tentsite is close to Mizpah Hut, and has five single
and two double tent platforms.</li>

<li>The AMC operates the Hermit Lake shelters with the WMNF. They
are located at the base of Tuckerman's Ravine off the Tuckerman's
Ravine trail [ow: 2.4 miles, 1,850 feet, 2:10]. It is a convenient
base for a Mt. Washington trip. Tickets must be purchased at
Pinkham Notch Visitor Center before going to the
shelters.</li>

<h2><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Routes to Single Peaks</h2>

<h3><a name="Monroe" id="Monroe"></a>Mount Monroe</h3>

<p>Mount Monroe, at 5,384 feet, is the 4<sup>th</sup> highest
mountain in New Hampshire. From the Lake of the Clouds Hut,
however, it is completely dwarfed by neighboring Mount Washington.
It is usually climbed by taking the <b>Ammonoosuc Ravine</b> trail
to Lakes of the Clouds hut, then taking the <b>Crawford Path</b>
and <b>Mount Monroe Loop</b> [rt: 7.2 miles, 2,900 feet, 5:05] to
the summit. It is a steep and rough trail, some may be more
comfortable doing the longer trip over both Eisenhower and Monroe,
using the <b>Edmands</b> and <b>Crawford Paths</b>, described
below.</p>

<h3><a name="Eisenhower" id="Eisenhower"></a>Mount Eisenhower</h3>

<p>Mount Eisenhower is most often climbed by the <b>Edmands
Path</b> and the <b>Mount Eisenhower Loop</b> [rt: 6.6 miles, 2,750
feet, 4:40] when done alone. The trail is never very steep, and the
footing is good. This hike gives excellent views for a very
reasonable effort, but remember that the summit is fully exposed to
the weather.</p>

<h3><a name="Pierce" id="Pierce"></a>Mount Pierce (Clinton)</h3>

<p>Mount Pierce is usually climbed by the <b>Crawford Path</b> [rt:
6.4 miles, 2,400 feet, 4:25] when done alone. This was originally a
bridle path, it is nowhere really steep and the footing is
good.</p>

<p>It is possible to extend the trip slightly to visit Mizpah Hut on
either the way up or the way down (lp: 6.6, 2,400, 4:30).  This
involves using the Webster Cliff Trail from the summit to the hut, and
the Mizpah Cutoff to regain the Crawford Path.  </p>

<h3><a name="Jackson" id="Jackson"></a>Mount Jackson</h3>

<p>Mount Jackson is usually climbed by the <b>Jackson Branch of the
Webster-Jackson Trail</b> [rt: 5.2 miles, 2,150 feet, 3:40] when
done alone. Though the average gradient of the trail is definitely
not steep (2,150 feet over 2.6 miles) it is somewhat deceptive, as
there are several rather flat sections that alternate with much
steeper ones. Nevertheless it is one of the easier 4000 footers,
and has excellent views (as do all the peaks in this section).</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the times for the peaks other than Mount
Washington:</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Routes to Multiple
Peaks</h2>

<p>The summits on the main ridge are fairly close to each other,
and it is quite easy to arrange trips (loops or round trips,
depending on the availability of a second car) over more than one
summit. I find the continuous views one gets hiking along the ridge
(in good weather, of course!) much more attractive than just going
to a summit, seeing the views, and returning to the trees. The
ultimate route to multiple peaks is, of course, the
<a href="presidential-traverse.html">Presi Traverse</a>!</p>

<p>Here are some sample loops (requiring a car unless noted):</p>

<h3>Mt. Washington and Mt. Monroe</h3>

<p>Adding Mt. Monroe to an ascent of Mt. Mount Washington using the
Ammonoosuc Ravine trail (either alone or with the Jewell trail)
will add 1.0 mile, 400 feet and 0:40. That does not seem much, but
it is an addition to a long hike! No car needed for the loop as
both trails start from the same trailhead.</p>

<h3>Mt. Monroe and Mt. Eisenhower</h3>

<p>One way is to go up the by the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail to Mt.
Monroe, then along the Crawford Path to Mt. Eisenhower, and down by
Edmands Path [lp: 9.0 miles, 3,350 feet, 6:10]. Those uncomfortable
with the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail may prefer to go up the Edmands
Path and follow the Crawford Path to Monroe, returning the same way
[rt: 9.8 miles, 3,800 feet, 6:50].</p>

<h3><a name="IkePierce" id="IkePierce"></a>Mt. Eisenhower and Mt.
Pierce</h3>

<p>This is most often done as a loop by going up Edmands Path and down
the Crawford Path (lp: 8.1 miles, 3,100 feet, 5:35). Doing it in the
opposite direction adds only 80 feet of elevation gain.  Both the
Edmands and Crawford Paths are gentle, and this is probably the
easiest trip with a lot of time spent above treeline.</p>

<p>With one car it is usually done by taking the Crawford Path and
going over both summits (rt: 9.6 miles, 3,250 feet, 6:25), though it
can be done in the opposite direction, going up Edmands Path to the
summit of Eisenhower and going to Pierce by the Crawford Path (rt: 10
miles, 3,650 feet, 6:50). Those doing the trip up Edmands Path can
save about 300 feet of elevation by only going over Mount Eisenhower
once, bypassing it on the Crawford Path on the return trip.</p>

<h3>Mt. Pierce and Mt. Jackson</h3>

<p>This is done by taking the Crawford Path to its junction with
the Webster Cliff Trail, then following that trail over Mt. Pierce
to Mt. Jackson, and descending by the Jackson branch of the
Webster-Jackson Trail. The loop, in either direction is 8.3 miles,
2,650 feet, 5:30. The section between Mizpah hut and the summit of
Pierce is steep and rough. The two trails have have separate
trailheads, but they are so close together that there is no need
for a second car.</p>

<h3>Mt. Jackson and Mt. Webster</h3>

<p>Doing these two peaks by the Webster-Jackson trail (in either
direction) is a classic loop (6.5 miles, 2,500 feet, 4:30). Mt.
Webster is not a 4,000 footer, but it has great views into Crawford
Notch.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the distances of the loops described:</p>

<h2><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Hut Based Routes</h2>

<p>The <a href="amc-huts.html">AMC hut system</a> can be used to
break up the long trips to the major peaks in the Presidential
range into more manageable pieces. In this section I will describe
an overnight trip to Monroe and Washington and a two night traverse
of most of the Presidential range, the overnight to Madison and
Adams is <a href="npresi.html#MadHut">described</a> under the
Northern Presidentials.</p>

<h3><a name="Washhut" id="Washhut"></a>Mt. Washington and Mt.
Monroe using Lakes of the Clouds Hut</h3>

<p>Staying overnight at Lakes of the Clouds Hut allows this
strenuous trip to be split. On the first day go up the Ammonoosuc
Ravine trail to the hut [ow: 3.1 miles, 2,500 feet, 2:50] and
settle down. Then do the short climb up Monroe and back [rt: 1.0
mile, 400 feet and 0:40]. Next day climb up Washington and down by
the Jewell trail [ow: 7.9 miles, 1,300 feet, 4:35].</p>

Traverse</h3>
