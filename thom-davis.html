<h1>White Mountain 4,000 Footers in One Winter<br />Thom Davis, Winter 2003-2004</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>In October 2003 Sue Johnston, Thom Davis and Bob Williams started
planning an attempt at setting a record for the New Hampshire 4,000
footers in winter.  They started out on December 26<sup>th</sup>, and
Thom injured himself that day.  After taking the next day off he
rejoined them, and by the time they had finished in the early hours of
January 6<sup>th</sup> he had done 35 peaks.  Over the next three
weeks he finished the remaining peaks, with a total elapsed time
of 34 days, 10 hours and 50 minutes.  He has written his own very
modest account of his adventure; I have extracted details from Bob
Williams' daily postings to give a more complete picture of that
phase.  </p>

<ul>

<li>December 26<sup>th</sup>.  He started out with them, and went up
the ski slopes to Wildcat D, then over the ridge and down to the hut.
Somewhere in the notch he injured himself, he writes: "I had planted
my face and chest into the ice on the floor of Carter Notch following
our descent of Wildcat A and barely dragged myself up Carter Dome."
He had to bail out by the 19 Mile Brook Trail, while they did the rest
of the Carter-Moriah range.</li>

<li>December 27<sup>th</sup>.  He did not hike, while they did the
Twins, Garfield and Galehead.</li>

<li>December 28<sup>th</sup>.  He was recovered enough to join them on
the Northern Presidentials, going over Mounts Madison, Adams,
Jefferson and Washington, then down the Lions Head.</li>

<li>December 29<sup>th</sup>.  He joined them for part of the trip,
going over Mounts Jackson, Pierce, Eisenhower and Monroe.  They
continued to Mount Isolation and out to Rt. 16, while he returned over
the Crawford Path to the notch.</li>

<li>December 30<sup>th</sup>.  He hiked with them all day, first doing
the Willey Range, then Mount Cabot.</li>

<li>December 31<sup>st</sup>.  He joined them doing the Kinsman Ridge,
but did not do Mount Tecumseh with them.</li>

<li>January 1<sup>st</sup>.  Bob and Sue went over Mount Hale on their
way to doing Zealand and the Bonds, while Thom bypassed it; they met
on the windy summit of Mount Guyot.</li>

<li>January 2<sup>nd</sup>.  Bob and Sue did the Franconia Ridge,
while Thom "gives his toe blister a day off."</li>

<li>January 3<sup>rd</sup>.  A snowy and rainy day.  Thom does the
Hancocks then leaves to dry out, while Bob and Sue do the Osceolas
and, after a dinner in Lincoln, Moosilauke.  After a trip to a
laundromat in Lincoln, Thom did the Osceolas alone, meeting Sue and
Bob as he was going up the slide.</li>

<li>January 4<sup>th</sup>.  All three do the Tripyramids, Whiteface
and Passaconaway together.</li>

<li>January 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup>.  Thom does the
Franconia Ridge while Bob and Sue to Owlshead and Carrigain, then
joins them for the grand finish on Waumbek.
</li>

</ul>

<p>After that he worked on the remaining peaks in a more leisurely
way.  Over the course of a bit more than a week he did six of the
missing peaks as single peak hikes, alone:</p>

<ul>
<li>January 6<sup>th</sup>.  Mount Tecumseh after dark (2.5 hours RT,
+10&deg;F on summit).</li>
<li>January 7<sup>th</sup>.  Mount Carrigain (7.2 hrs RT, -5&deg;F on
summit).</li>
<li>January 10<sup>th</sup>.  Mount Hale after dark (4.5 hrs RT,
-25&deg;F on summit).</li>
<li>January 11<sup>th</sup>.  Mount Isolation (7.5 hrs RT via Rocky
Branch Trail, 0&deg;F on summit).</li>
<li>January 12<sup>th</sup>.  Owlshead (8.9 hrs RT via Black Pond
cutoff, mild).</li>
<li>January 13<sup>th</sup>.  Mount Moosilauke (5.0 hrs
RT via Glencliff Trail, +5&deg;F on summit with whiteout).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thom did the final seven peaks in two hikes with Cathy Goodwin.
The following is taken from his write ups of those two hikes:</p>

<p>January 19<sup>th</sup>.  N Twin, S Twin, Galehead, and Garfield.
After spotting my car at the Garfield Trailhead near Five Corners,
Cathy Goodwin and I left her car at the Seven Dwarfs Motel near the
head of Little River Road (we always pay the owner $3) and began
hiking at 9 am. All three crossings of the Little River are now well
frozen over. After bare booting up to about 3000 ft, we snowshoed the
rest of the way. We reached N Twin at about 12:30 pm, S Twin about
1:10 pm (just off the summit out of the wind, we stopped for a short
moment of silence for Kenneth Holmes), Galehead hut about 1:35 pm,
Galehead summit and back to the hut by about 2:30 pm, East Garfield
Ridge Peak (3590 ft) about 3:15 pm (easy bushwhack), Garfield Ridge
Trail / Garfield Trail Jct about 5:15 pm, Garfield summit 5:30 pm,
Garfield trailhead at about 7:30 pm, so 10 hr, 30 min total. We
skipped West Garfield Ridge Peak (3667 ft) for sake of time. One
tricky spot of snow-covered water ice on steepest pitch below tent
platforms on Garfield Ridge Trail (crampons would have been useful if
we had them, but snowshoes and ski poles worked). Temperatures hovered
around 0&deg;F all day/evening long; wind gusts up to 20-25 mph on
summits.  </p>

<p>At 5:50 pm on Thursday, January 29th 2004, Cathy Goodwin and I
completed a traverse of S&amp;M Carter (no pun intended) and Moriah at
the C-M Trailhead in Gorham, after departing the 19-Mile Brook
Trailhead at 9:30 am. We bare-booted the first part of the route until
we began encountering snowdrifts up to 4 ft deep on the C-M Trail just
north of the North Carter Trail Jct., which led us to don snowshoes
for the remainder of the hike. Temperatures hovered around 0&deg;F the
entire day, with wind gusts pushing high 30s and low 40s mph on the
ledges south of Moriah. Cathy used a pocket anemometer to measure a
steady 27 mph wind speed on the summit of Moriah, but that was after
higher gusts had relented.</p>
