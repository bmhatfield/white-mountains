I am a 65 year old male (in 2002), retired and dividing my time
between the Boston area and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. I
hike year round, trying to go out about three times a week. When in
the White Mountains I usually hike 4000 footers, when in the Boston
area I most often hike in the <a href="strenuous.html">Blue
Hills</a>. 

<p>Not only do I hike, but I bag peaks! I have written a short essay
on <a href="whybag.html">my perspective on peakbagging</a>, and indeed
the main part of <a href="index.html">this site</a> is devoted to
peakbagging in New England.</p>

<p>As a regular New England peakbagger I have bagged the highpoints
of New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont. I have been going to Colorado
for a week or two since the summer of 2000, and in 2002 I bagged
both the Colorado and California highpoints. In the spring of 2003
I added Massachusetts and Connecticut as part of a very enjoyable
four day trip to the Berkshires.</p>

<p>With a grand total of eight highpoints to my credit I can hardly
call myself a highpointer <img src="images/smile.gif" alt="smile" />,
but I plan to attempt several others over the next year or so, who
knows what will happen after that!</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Mount Washington, New
Hampshire</h2>

<p>I have climbed Mt. Washington perhaps a half dozen times, and
have written reports of two trips that are not completely
conventional, plus one standard trip with a couple of twists. One
describes a summer climb up the steep and rugged
<a href="great-gulf.html">Great Gulf</a> trail, with spectacular
views in the Great Gulf as we climbed above Spaulding Lake. A
spectacular trip, not easy with its 5,000 feet of elevation gain,
but well worth it for those who can do it.</p>

<p>The second, and chronologically earliest, report is of a
<a href="mt-washington-winter.html">winter half Presidential
Traverse</a>, going up Mount Washington and then down the Crawford
Path over Mounts Monroe, Eisenhower and, for some of the group,
Pierce. I came down with the flu during that trip, but the sight of
a full moon shining off the ice and snow as we camped near Mount
Monroe is one I shall never forget.</p>

<p>On a beautiful mid-September day (in 2002) I climbed Mt.
Washington by the classic
<a href="mt-washington-ammonoosuc.html">Ammonoosuc Ravine - Jewell
Trail</a> loop. There were two unusual components to that otherwise
very standard trip: I started with no clear plan, just wanting to
enjoy a glorious day above treeline, and having reached Mount
Washington I went over to Mount Clay, adding a couple of miles and
some 500 feet of elevation gain. This is one of the easier ways up
the mountain (at least for those who plan to climb it under their
own steam!).</p>

<p>For a discussion of the various routes up Mt. Washington,
including distances and elevation gains, see the
<a href="washington.html">Mount Washington</a> page on this
site.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Mount Mansfield,
Vermont</h2>

<p>My first summer trip to Mount Mansfield (September 1998) really
does not deserve a trip report. I did the classic loop up the Long
Trail to the Chin (highest summit), then went over the ridge to the
main summit building, and descended by the Haselton Trail. For other
standard routes see the <a href="mt-mansfield.html">Mount
Mansfield</a> page.</p>

<p>I returned to <a href="mt-mansfield-winter.html">Mount Mansfield
in the winter</a> of 2001, as part of a long weekend bagging, in
addition, Camel's Hump and Mount Abraham. We used the Long Trail to
the Taft Lodge, then took the Profanity Trail to the summit,
returning the same way.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2003 I returned one more time, doing <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/mount-mansfield.html">Mount Mansfield by the Sunset Ridge
Trail</a>.  I enjoyed the trail very much, and hope to repeat it in
winter.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Katahdin, Maine</h2>

<p>There are too many details about my Katahdin trip (October 1999)
that I do not remember, I hope to return there soon! In the
meantime you may be interested in a friend's attempt to do
<a href="baxter97.html">Katahdin in winter</a>, her group succeeded
in doing the easier Hamlin Peak, but was unable to summit the
higher Baxter Peak.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref3a" id="tocref3a"></a>Mount Greylock,
Massachusetts and Mount Frissell, Connecticut</h2>

<p> In the spring of 2003 I went on a four day <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/berkshires.html">Highpointing
Trip to the Berkshires</a>, during which I climbed Mount Greylock and
Mount Frissell, as well as four other county highpoints.  While
preparing for that trip I researched the <a
href="mount-frissell.html">routes to Mount Frissell</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Mount Elbert, Colorado</h2>

<p>In July 2002 I spent two weeks in Colorado, and hiked up
<a href="elbert.html">Mount Elbert</a> by the North Mt. Elbert
Trail. A fairly straightforward hike, done after one week of easier
hikes. Since it was my third trip to Colorado I knew what to expect
from the high elevation, and how to cope with it.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Mount Whitney,
California</h2>

<p>In late August 2002 I went to California to climb
<a href="mount-whitney-2002.html">Mount Whitney</a>, and reached
the summit two days before my 65<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Mount Marcy,
New York</h2>

<p>In late August 2004 I went to the Adirondacks to climb <a
href="mount-marcy.html">Mount Marcy</a>, as well as a couple of county
highpoints.  By a strange coincidence I once again reached the summit
two days before my birthday, this time the 67<sup>th</sup>.  I decided
that I wanted to revisit it in the winter, and did so in <a
href="mount-marcy-winter-2005.html">March 2005</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Highpointers Convention (or
Konvention!) 2005</h2>

<p> The <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/highpointers-convention-2005.html">2005
Highpointers Convention</a> will be in New Hampshire, I will be
posting more information as it becomes available.</p>
