<p>This page answers many questions about doing a one day
Presidential Traverse and other big one day hikes in the White
Mountains of New Hampshire. You may also want to read about
<a href="my-presi-traverse.html">my Presi Traverse of 2001</a>.
There are also some notes on other "big hikes", the term "Death
March" is often used to describe them.</p>

<p><a name="presi1" id="presi1"></a><b>Q</b>. What is a Presi
Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. There is no official definition of a Presi Traverse (the
widely used shorthand for Presidential Range Traverse). I define it to
be a one day traverse of most or all of the peaks of the Presidential
range which have trails. It thus excludes John Quincy Adams (though he
was a president) and includes Clay and Franklin (though neither was a
president, and neither peak is an official 4,000 footer).  Many,
perhaps most, people exclude Franklin, as it is a trivial "peak", and
cannot be traversed (only one trail, so has to be an out and
back).</p>

<p>The minimal traverse goes over Madison, Adams, Jefferson, Clay,
Washington, Monroe, Franklin, Eisenhower and Pierce. Often Jackson
is added, more rarely Webster also. Since my definition has nothing
to do with the names or elevations of the peaks, I believe that a
full traverse should include Jackson (named after the State
geologist, not the president!) and Webster. Given the length of
even the minimal traverse it is understandable that many people are
fully satisfied by doing it.</p>

<p>Most people do it from North to South, as this gets most of the
elevation gain, and most of the rock hopping, out of the way
relatively early. The easiest way up Madison is by the Valley Way to
the hut, and then up and down the Osgood trail, but some prefer to
take the steeper and rougher Watson Path, traversing the summit of
Madison. A longer and more difficult alternative (rarely done) is to
use the Howker Ridge Trail to do Madison.  Beyond Madison there is no
choice, the Gulfside is followed to Washington, then the Crawford Path
to its junction with the Webster Cliff trail, taking all the loops
over the summits.</p>

<p>Those doing the minimal traverse then go up to the summit of
Pierce and return to the Crawford Path which they follow to the
road. Otherwise the Webster Cliff trail is followed, either just to
Jackson (exiting by the Jackson branch of the Webster-Jackson
trail) or all the way to Webster. In the latter case there are two
options, exit by either the Webster branch of the Webster-Jackson
trail, or continue on the Webster Cliff trail to the road.</p>

<p><a name="presi2" id="presi2"></a><b>Q</b>. How long is a Presi
Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The minimal traverse is 19.8 miles with 8,500 feet of
elevation gain. The table below gives figures for the minimal
traverse and the more common extensions.</p>

<p>A separate page gives the
<a href="traverse_times.html">distances and elevation gains</a> on
the segments of the minimal traverse, together with an Excel
spreadsheet that you can modify. You can also read a trip report on
my <a href="mytraverse2.html#trip">2001 Presi Traverse
attempt</a>.</p>

<p><a name="presi3" id="presi3"></a><b>Q</b>. Where can I get water
and food during a Presi Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The minimal traverse passes by Madison hut, the Mt.
Washington summit and Lakes of the Clouds hut, longer traverses
also pass by Mizpah hut. Water can be obtained at all of these
locations. Most people doing the traverse will reach Madison hut
before breakfast, so left over brownies will not be available. It
is possible to eat a full lunch at the Mt Washington summit, and to
buy snacks at the remaining huts.</p>

<p>The huts and summit must be used with discipline. They greatly
diminish the amount of water that needs to be carried, but there is
a temptation to stay too long there.</p>

<p><a name="presi4" id="presi4"></a><b>Q</b>. How long will it take
to do a Presi Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. This is difficult to predict, as for most people it is
a significantly longer trip than usual. It is one thing to beat
book time on a ten mile and 3,000 foot day, quite another to even
match it on a twenty mile day with more than double the elevation
gain! I would guess that hikers who normally beat book time by
about 20% should anticipate requiring at least full book time on a
traverse.</p>

<p>The good news is that, beyond Washington, there is no sustained
elevation gain, though late in the day even the 300 foot climbs
required to summit Monroe and Eisenhower seem long. Also the
Crawford Path is a good smooth trail.</p>

<p><a name="presi5" id="presi5"></a><b>Q</b>. How do I prepare for
a Presi Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. There are two components to preparing for a traverse:
endurance and climbing. You should certainly do a few very long
hikes like the <a href="bondrts.html#Bonds">Bonds</a>, plus shorter
hikes with substantial elevation gain, like
<a href="npresi.html#MadAdams">Madison and Adams</a>. If you live
in the Boston area the <a href="strenuous.html">Blue Hills</a> are
a good place in which to train when you cannot go up north. Expect
the traverse to be tiring in spite of your training unless you are
exceptionally fit. Read about how I
<a href="my-presi-traverse.html#Training">trained</a> for my 2001
attempt.</p>

<p><a name="presi6" id="presi6"></a><b>Q</b>. Logistics of a Presi
Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Ideally you should spend the night before and the
night after the traverse in northern New Hampshire. Cars should be
spotted the night before and plans made for a very early start.
Most people try to start some time between 4 and 5 AM. You may want
to read <a href="my-presi-traverse.html#Logistics">how we did
it</a>.</p>

<p>As a minimum you need one car at the end of the traverse, and a
second one to take you to the start. If more cars are available it
is a very good idea to leave one at the Cog Railway base station,
this will allow you to bail out by either the Jewell or Ammonoosuc
Ravine trails in case of bad weather or fatigue. If planning to
exit by the Webster Cliff trail a car should be left at the
Crawford trailhead, that allows you to bail out at Pierce or
Jackson.</p>

<p><a name="presi6a" id="presi6a"></a><b>Q</b>. When do people do a
Presi Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The most popular day is the Saturday closest to the
Summer Solstice, to get as much daylight as possible. All you
really need, of course, is a long day. Checking the times of
<a href="sun_nh_2001.html">sunrise and sunset</a> shows that there
are more than 15 hours of sunlight from some time in late May until
some time in late July. That is only 30 minutes less than the
longest day, and probably makes little real difference.</p>

<p>Since Mud Season, which makes serious training on the trails
rather difficult, often lasts until Memorial Day I prefer to do it
later rather than sooner within that window.</p>

<p><a name="presi7" id="presi7"></a><b>Q</b>. What is a moonlight
Presi Traverse?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. You select a night with a full (or almost full) moon
and pray for good weather. Usually you start from Appalachia early
enough to get to the summit of Madison by sunset, then you go over
the ridge, celebrating sunrise on Washington or Monroe.</p>

<p>With good weather this can be a magic experience, but given the
unpredictability of weather in the Presidentials it is a high risk
trip.</p>
