<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The National Weather Service in Burlington, VT, has a forecast for
<a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/">the Higher Summits of
Vermont and Northern New York</a> as well as a point forecast for <a
href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/point/CAMELS.txt">Camel's
Hump</a>.</p>

<p>You may want to look (in a separate window) at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=44.31944&amp;lon=-72.88667&amp;size=l">
Topozone Map</a> of the area around Camels Hump.</p>

<p>Camel's Hump (elevation 4,083 feet) is the highest undeveloped
mountain in Vermont, with no structures at the summit. Its rocky
summit rises a few hundred feet above treeline, giving it an alpine
feel that is only found on it and on Mount Mansfield in Vermont.
Please protect the delicate alpine vegetation!</p>

<p>The most common approaches to Camels Hump are fairly short trips
from either the east or the west, though a much longer approach
from the north is possible. From either the east or the west there
is a choice of an up and down trip or a longer and more interesting
loop.</p>

<p>The direct way from the east is by the <b>Monroe Trail</b> to
the LT, then a short distance south on the LT to the summit (rt:
6.8 miles; 2,600 feet; 4:40). A very popular alternative is to make
a loop, taking the <b>Dean Trail</b> where it branches off the
Monroe Trail to Wind Gap, then going north along the LT to the
summit, returning by the Monroe Trail (lp: 8.0 miles; 2,600 feet;
5:20). There is a steep scramble going up to the summit by the LT,
and at one time it appears as if one will have to climb some very
impressive cliffs! These cliffs are bypassed on the west. It is
possible to add a mile and 30 minutes to either of these routes by
following the LT north of the summit beyond Gorham Lodge and then
taking the <b>Alpine Trail</b> back to the Monroe Trail.</p>

<p>From the west the direct approach is by the <b>Burrow's
Trail</b> which joins the LT just north of the summit (rt: 4.8
miles; 2,300 feet; 3:30). A longer and more interesting variation
is to take a short connector trail to the <b>Forest City Trail</b>,
and follow that trail to its junction with the LT at Wind Gap, then
following the LT to the summit. Descend by going north on the LT to
its junction with the Burrow's Trail, and return by that trail (lp:
6.0 miles; 2,300 feet; 4:10).</p>

<p>The longest approach is from the north, taking the LT south from
River Road to the summit (rt: 12.4 miles; 3,700 feet; 8:05). This
large elevation gain is due to the very low elevation of the
trailhead, only 400 feet above sea level. There are many good
viewpoints along the way, in addition to the views from the
summit.</p>
