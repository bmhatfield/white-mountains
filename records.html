<p>This section will attempt to document <i>some</i> peakbagging
records and other achievements in the mountains of New England.  Since
New Hampshire has most of the 4,000 footers that is where most such
achievements take place, but I will also collect similar ones in Maine
and Vermont.</p>

<p>Basically I am interested in documenting new achievements as they
take place, and will attempt to go back and find information on
earlier ones to put the current ones in context. The AMC 4,000 Footer
Committee does not recognize speed (or any other) records, so this
compilation is purely informal.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Speed Records</h2>

<p>The issue of speed records is rather controversial in the hiking
community, many hikers believe that such records are irrelevant to
hiking, while others care a lot about them. Personally I have very
mixed feelings: I do not see hiking as a competitive sport, but I
very much enjoy the feeling of my body working as hard as it is
capable.</p>

<p>In any case, many people do care about them, and this site is as
good a place as any in which to try to collect them.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>The Fitch Brothers, Summer
1973</h3>

<p>In August 1973 George and Tom Fitch, aged 17 and 15 respectively,
climbed the 46 peaks then on the list in six days, 15 hours and 30
minutes, finishing at Madison Hut. Their record is unique in several
ways: they had absolutely no support, they used one car (with a
bicycle to retrieve the car on traverses), and they slept in the car.
I consider that the supreme Tom Sawyer accomplishment in New England
hiking history!  I am reproducing an excellent article from the <i>AMC
Outdoors</i>, <a href="fitch-record.html">Oh, Brothers: The Fitch boys
climbed 46 \ peaks&mdash;in seven days</a> with the kind permission of
the author and the Publisher.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Al Sochard, Bill Parlette
and Doug Mayer, Summers of 1991 and 2001</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1991 these three hikers climbed the 48 peaks now
on the list in eight days (they dubbed it "The Hike From Hell").  They
were aware of the Fitch brothers' record, but their purpose was to
have a fun adventure, and eight days seemed right.  Ten years later
they were able to repeat it, a remarkable achievement. Doug Mayer
wrote a humorous piece about the first trip for <i>Appalachia</i>,
June 1992, that said little about the actual adventure.  He has been
kind enough to send me an itinerary of <a href="eight-days.html">The
Hike From Hell</a>, which I have used to create a <a
href="eight-day-table.html">table of distances and elevation
gains</a>.  He also sent me a couple of emails about their motivation.
I will quote one of them briefly here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... get you some thoughts about the hikes. For me anyway, they
were about having a silly, fun adventure with my pals in the
mountains. I have such GREAT memories of those hikes. I was
challenged to my personal max, which was just what I wanted. Al and
I were just talking about these hikes on the way up to Tucks the
other morning&mdash;we always realized these hikes were about
creating an adventure for ourselves. Hopefully others have been
similarly inspired. In a few years, I'm sure we'll do the four
thousand footers again. Who knows. I also like doing the one day,
summer huts traverse&mdash;that's a great test of summer
fitness.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have reproduce the other <a
href="doug-mayer-email.html">email</a> in full on its own page.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6"></a>Maine and Vermont Fours in Five Days</h3>

<p>In 1993 a group, which included Sue Johnston, Al Sochard, Bill
Parlette, Doug Mayer and others, did the five Vermont 4,000 footers in
one day, then drove to Maine and did the 12 (they are now 14) peaks
then considered 4,000 footers in another four days. This trip, which
involved a lot of driving in addition to the hiking, was dubbed "The
Hike From Heck".  Doug Mayer wrote a piece similar in spirit to the
one on their New Hampshire adventure in the June 1994
<i>Appalachia</i>.  Sue Johnston was kind enough to give me the
itinerary of <a href="hike-from-heck.html">The Hike From Heck</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a> Ted E. Keizer (Cave Dog),
Summer 2002</h3>

<p>In August 2002 <a href="http://www.thedogteam.com/">Ted Keizer
(Cave Dog)</a>, who had established a record for doing the Colorado
fourteeners, was the first person to attempt the
<a href="http://www.thedogteam.com/Whites-Web_Pages/Whites_48/Whites_48.html">
White Mountain 4,000 footers</a> in ultramarathon style, hiking
(often running) almost continuously with minimal sleep. He finished
on the summit of Waumbek in 3 days, 17 hours and 21 minutes. His
site gives details of the
<a href="http://www.thedogteam.com/Whites-Web_Pages/Whites-Times/Whites-Times.html">
times</a> to various landmarks (summits and cols).</p>

<p>As the first person to attempt this record in ultramarathon
style he set the
<a href="http://www.thedogteam.com/Whites-Web_Pages/Whites-Rules.html">
rules</a>, one of which was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>4. The Clock: The clock starts at the trailhead of the first
peak climbed and stops at the summit of the last
peak.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That rule puts a premium on ending as far from the road as
possible, since the final run back to the car is not counted in the
time. This has caused some controversy on the bulletin boards, but
I must point out that the Fitch brothers did the same, ending the
timed trip at Madison Hut (where they spent the night) rather than
at the trailhead.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Tim Seaver, Summer 2003</h3>

<p>In July 2003 <a href="http://www.vermontphoto.com/">Tim
Seaver</a> broke Ted "Cave Dog" Keizer's previous record, finishing
on Owl's Head in 3 days, 15 hours, and 51 minutes. He covered 184.4
miles with 62,436 feet of elevation gain in that period. The
details are available in a large
<a href="http://www.vermontphoto.com/wildwhites/WildWhitesActualTimes.htm">
spreadsheet</a> on his site, which contains a running narrative
besides the times, distances and elevation gains.</p>
