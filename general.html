<p><b>Unless mentioned explicitly, information here applies to the
normal hiking season, which extends roughly from Memorial Day to
Columbus Day. Conditions in winter, and in the potentially equally
dangerous late fall and early spring, are very different and
require a completely different approach.</b> Late spring is
<a href="http://www.greenmountainclub.org/page.php?id=60">Mud
Season</a>, when there is a mixture of mud at lower elevations and
melting snow at higher elevations, it leads to unpleasant hiking
and to damaging erosion of trails. <a name="Books"
id="Books"></a></p>

<h2>Guidebooks and Maps</h2>

<p>A serious hiker will want at least one good, comprehensive guide
book for each region, together with a set of maps. I will mention
the "official" guidebooks for each region, of course there are an
enormous number of others. The
<a href="http://www.mountainwanderer.com">Mountain Wanderer
Bookstore</a> is an excellent resource for those wanting a wider
choice of books and maps. <a name="Books.NH" id="Books.NH"></a></p>

<h3>New Hampshire</h3>

<p>For New Hampshire the essential guidebook is the <i>White
Mountain Guide</i> published by the AMC. It describes every trail
in the White Mountains, and gives distances and elevation gains,
together with descriptions which are more useful to the hiker than
those in most of the other guidebooks that I have seen. It has to
be read carefully, often the vital information about steepness or
other difficulty is in a single sentence. But if you read the
description carefully you will rarely find any surprises on the
trail.</p>

<p>Starting with the 26<sup>th</sup> Edition (published in 1998) a
new set of maps, generated by using GPS on the entire trail system,
is included. The maps that come with the book are printed on paper,
a set of maps printed on Tyvec (very resistant to tearing and to
water) is available separately. The maps published with earlier
editions are much less good, if you have an earlier edition get at
least the new maps.</p>

<p>The 26<sup>th</sup> edition also shows the elevations of all the
points in the summary tables, this is essential information for
those using an altimeter.</p>

<p>The 26<sup>th</sup> edition no longer includes information on
most trails south of Rt 25. They are now covered in a new
publication, the <i>Southern New Hampshire Trail Guide</i>. This
comes with a map, produced like those of the <i>White Mountain
Guide</i>, showing the trails on Mt. Monadnock on one side, and
those on Mt. Cardigan on the other. The map included with the book
is printed on paper, a Tyvec map is available separately.</p>

<p><i>The 4,000-Footers of the White Mountains, A Guide and
History</i>, by Steve Smith and Mike Dickerman, is a new book that
will probably join the <i>White Mountain Guide</i> as an essential
companion to serious hikers in the region. I have written a
<a href="review.html">review</a> of it for the Charles River Mud,
the newsletter of the Boston chapter of the AMC.</p>

<p>There are several guidebooks that describe selected trails in
more detail, with notes on the history and on the trees and birds
encountered. You may wish to have one or more of them, I have found
the following very interesting:</p>
<br />

<ul>

<li><i>Fifty Hikes in the White Mountains</i> by Daniel and Ruth
Doan.</li>

<li><i>Fifty More Hikes in New Hampshire</i> by Daniel and Ruth
Doan.</li>

<li><i>Ponds and Lakes of the White Mountains</i> by Steven
Smith.</li>
</ul>

<p>One book that I pack with me when going to summits with good
views is Brent Scudder's <i>Scudder's White Mountain Viewing
Guide</i>. It gives detailed 360 degree panoramas for 43 peaks,
together with some notes on how to get there, and a partial text
description of the views.</p>

<p>The AMC maps are so good that it is difficult to justify
purchasing other maps. Three that I use are:</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Delorme Trail Map and Guide to the WMNF</i> which covers the
entire White Mountains in one map, and is useful for seeing the
"big picture" from summits.</li>

<li><i>Mount Washington and the Heart of the Presidential
Range</i>, a very detailed and accurate map made by noted
cartographer and mountaineer Bradford Washburn. A classic.</li>

<li><i>Randolph Valley and the Northern Peaks of the Mount
Washington Range</i> by the Randolph Mountain Club (RMC). A
beautiful and detailed map, the one I normally use when hiking in
the Northern Presidentials. It is available either separately or
with a guidebook, <i>Randolph Paths</i>, also produced by the
RMC.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a descrition of the many other maps that cover the White
Mountains see my <a href="nh-hiking-maps.html">New Hampshire Hiking
Maps</a> page.</p>

<h3>Maine</h3>

<p>For <b>Maine</b> the essential guidebook is the <i>AMC Maine
Mountain Guide</i> published by the AMC. Trail descriptions are not
as detailed as those in the <i>White Mountain Guide</i>, but they
are fully adequate. Starting with the 8<sup>th</sup> Edition (1999)
there is a set of maps produced with GPS. The maps that come with
the guidebook are printed on paper, many peakbaggers will want to
purchase the separate Tyvec versions.<br />
<br />
<a href="general.html#Top">Return to top</a></p>

<h3>Vermont</h3>

<p>For Vermont the essential guidebook is the <i>Long Trail
Guide</i> published by the Green Mountain Club (GMC). The maps that
come with the guide are not very detailed, many will want to get
the two maps published by Map Adventures. The first is the
<i>Northern Vermont Hiking Trails</i>, which map covers Mt.
Mansfield, Camel's Hump and more. The second is <i>Vermont and New
Hampshire Hiking</i>, which covers Killington, Abraham and Ellen,
as well as other areas. The GMC also publishes a <i>Trail Map of
Mt. Mansfield</i>.</p>

<p>All the Vermont Fours are covered in the <i>Long Trail
Guide</i>, but several of the peaks on the NE 100 Highest list are
not. These will be found described in the <i>Day Hiker's Guide to
Vermont</i>, also published by the GMC.<br />
