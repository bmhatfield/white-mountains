<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.28982&lon=-71.17659&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">South
Carter</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4908601&amp;e=325973&amp;size=l&amp;s=250&amp;layer=drg100">
Topozone map</a> of this section of the White Mountains of New
Hampshire. The main trails are marked, but not labelled.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC operates one hut and one campsite in the area. Fees are
charged at both, reservations are required at the hut, but not
accepted at the campsite.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="carter-notch-hut.html">Carter Notch Hut</a> is
located near the junction of the Nineteen Mile Brook and Wildcat
Ridge trails (ow: 3.8 miles, 1,900 feet, 2:50). It operates on a
self-service basis year round, and because of its proximity to the
road and easy grades is much used by families. It is not very
useful for peakbaggers, but may be used as part of a traverse of
the range.</li>

<li>The Imp Campsite is located on a spur off the Carter Moriah
trail between Moriah and North Carter. It has a shelter and five
tentsites. Most peakbaggers bag the peaks in this area on daytrips,
but like the Carter Notch Hut this campsite can be used as part of
a traverse of the range.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Routes</h2>

<h3><a name="Moriah" id="Moriah"></a>Mount Moriah</h3>

<p>There are two routes up Mt. Moriah. One is the fairly gentle climb
up the Carter-Moriah trail from Gorham (rt: 9.0 miles, 3,550 feet,
6:15). The other, by the Stony Brook and Carter-Moriah trails (rt:
10.0 miles, 3,150 feet, 6:35) includes a steep section. Both offer
great views (and blueberries in season) from open ledges, and the
views from the summit are excellent. They can be combined as a loop
ascending by Stony Brook (lp: 9.5 miles, 3,300 feet, 6:25), this
requires a second car or a road walk. Fortunately there is a
pedestrian bridge over the Peabody River that allows a <a
href="moriah-shortcut.html">shortcut</a> that reduces this walk by
about a mile.</p>

<h3><a name="Carters" id="Carters"></a>Middle and South Carter</h3>

<p>Middle and South Carter are often done together, going up the
Nineteen Mile Brook and Carter Dome trails to Zeta Pass, then North
along the Carter-Moriah trail over both peaks, and down by the
North Carter and Imp trails (lp: 10.8, 3,500 feet, 7:10). With one
car only you can either retrace your steps, or (if you are
comfortable navigating off-trail) bushwhack from the Imp trail,
where it is close to Cowboy Brook, to the Nineteen Mile trail near
the trailhead.</p>

<p>If doing <b>Middle Carter</b> alone, use the Imp, North Carter
and Carter-Moriah trails (rt: 9.8 miles, 3,500 feet, 6:40). If
doing <b>South Carter</b> alone take the Nineteen Mile and Carter
Dome trails to Zeta Pass, then the Carter-Moriah trail to South
Carter (rt: 9.2 miles, 2,950 feet, 6:05).</p>

<h3><a name="Dome" id="Dome"></a>Carter Dome</h3>

<p>The easiest route is by the Nineteen Mile Brook and Carter Dome
trails (rt: 10.0 miles, 3,350 feet, 6:40). This has good footing
and easy grades almost all the time.  <b>Mount Hight</b>, which
has better views, can be added by climbing it by the Carter Moriah
Trail from Zeta Pass, and following that trail to the summit of Carter
Dome.  Descent is then by the Carter Dome Trail.  This will add 0.2
miles and 150 feet, for an extra ten minutes of hiking time.  Note,
that the ascent from Zeta Pass to Mount Hight is steep with very rough
footing.</p>

<p>A more challenging approach is to take the Nineteen Mile Brook
trail to Carter Notch, then the Carter-Moriah trail over Carter Dome
and Mt. Hight to Zeta Pass, then descend by the Carter Dome and
Nineteen Mile Brook trails (lp: 10.2 miles, 3,600 feet, 6:55). While
Carter Dome has good views, those from Mt Height are even
better.</p>

<p>Using either of these routes <b>South Carter</b> can be added for
an extra 1.6 miles and 550 feet adding 1:10 to book time.</p>

<h3><a name="Wildcats" id="Wildcats"></a>The Wildcats</h3>

<p>Normally done by the Wildcat Ridge and Nineteen Mile Brook
trails (lp: 8.7 miles, 3,150 feet, 5:55), a second car is required.
The Wildcat Ridge trail is substantially more strenuous than the
distance and elevation gain would suggest. The crossing of the
Ellis River at the start of the Wildcat Ridge trail may be
difficult, if so return to Pinkham Notch and take the Lost Pond
trail to the Wildcat Ridge beyond the crossing, this adds 0.9 miles
and 100 feet.</p>

<p>It is possible to add Carter Dome to this hike, taking the
Carter-Moriah Trail from Carter Notch over the summit of Carter Dome
to Zeta Pass, and then taking the Carter Dome Trail to the 19-Mile
Brook Trail (lp: 11.3 miles; 4,850 feet; 8:05).</p>
