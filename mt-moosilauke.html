<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>Mt. Moosilauke is the most westerly of the New Hampshire Fours.
In good weather you get great views to the west into Vermont and
New York from its bare summit.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a

<h2><a name="tocref2"></a>Trails</h2>
<b>Gorge Brook</b> trail, starting at the Ravine Lodge, is probably
the most popular trail on Mount Moosilauke (rt: 7.4 miles, 2,550
feet, 5:00). Since Ravine Lodge is the highest trailhead on the
mountain, this is the trail with the least elevation gain. It has
been relocated recently to avoid the steepest parts of the old
trail, and is now relatively easy. 

<p>The <b>Beaver Brook</b> trail, though equally short (rt: 7.6
miles, 3,100 feet, 5:20), has an extremely steep and rough section
along the beautiful cascades. This section can be slippery when wet
or icy.</p>

<p>The <b>Glencliff trail</b> joins the Carriage Road at the base
of the South Peak (which has attractive views) and uses the last
0.9 mile of that trail to reach the summit (rt: 7.8 miles, 3,300
feet, 5:30), it has good footing and only one steep section.</p>

<p>The <b>Moosilauke Carriage Road</b> is wide and has good footing
most of the way, it also has the gentlest grades of any trail on
this mountain (rt: 10.2 miles, 3100 feet, 6:40).</p>

<p>Finally the <b>Benton Trail</b> (rt: 7.2 miles, 3,100 feet,
5:10) has moderate grades and good footing, but a stream crossing
near the start may be difficult at high water.</p>

<p>With all these trails a variety of loops are possible. With one
car there are two possible loops starting and ending at the Ravine
lodge. Go up Gorge Brook trail, and descend by either the Carriage
Road and Snapper trail (lp: 7.5 miles, 2,450 feet, 5:00) or by the
Beaver Brook and Asquam Ridge trails (lp: 9.6 miles, 2,450 feet,
6:00). A long loop recommended in the <i>White Mountain Guide</i>
uses the Benton, Glencliff and Tunnel Brook trails (lp: 13.3 miles,
3,100 feet, 8:10). With two cars it is possible to go up by the
very steep Beaver Brook trail and return by either the Gorge Brook
(lp: 7.5 miles, 3,100 feet, 5:20) or Glencliff (lp: 7.7 miles,
3,100 feet, 5;25).</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes up Mt. Moosilauke:</p>

<h2><a name="winter"></a>Mount Moosilauke in Winter</h2>

<p>Mount Moosilauke is the "other" above treeline peak.  There is less
exposure than in the Presidentials and Franconia Ridge, but all trails
have somewhere between &frac14; and &frac12; mile above treeline.  It
should only be attempted under good conditions.</p>

<p>The Gorge Brook Trail is the easiest, and in winter has the
additional advantage of being sheltered from the wind most of the
way.  On the other hand the Ravine Lodge Road is not plowed, adding
1.6 miles (each way) and 400 feet of elevation gain.  It also has the
shortest exposed section, about &frac14; mile.  The Ravine Lodge Road
is plowed up to the gate, with parking space for several cars.</p>

<p>The Glencliff Trail is another popular approach.  The trail is on
west (windward) side of the mountain, with no big mountains shielding
it, and is exposed to the wind even below treeline.  The final climb
to the junction with the Carriage Road is steep, and can be moderately
challenging if it has been packed hard by glissaders.  The last
&frac12; mile or so of the Carriage Road is fully exposed to the wind.
The South Peak can easily be added to this hike, it offers different
views than the main peak.</p>

<p>The Beaver Brook Trail is the third possibility.  The section beside
the brook is very steep and may be icy.</p>
