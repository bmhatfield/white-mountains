<p>Carter Notch Hut (elevation 3,300 feet) is the easternmost of
the AMC huts. Like the Lonesome Lake and Zealand Huts it is
accessible without too much effort, and like them it is open in
winter. In winter it is used far more by snowshoers than by skiers,
as the final parts of both the Nineteen Mile Brook and Wildcat
River trails are too steep for most skiers.</p>

<p>Its setting, below the steep faces of Wildcat and Carter Dome,
is impressive. Closer to the hut there is the impressive jumble of
rocks known as "The Ramparts", as well as the two lakes. It is open
year round on a low cost "self service" basis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At AMC Self-service huts, guests
provide their own food and have full use of the hut's stove, oven, and
cookware to prepare their own meals. Bunks, mattresses, and pillows are
provided, but blankets are not. Be sure to bring a warm sleeping bag if
you're staying at a self-service hut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AMC web site has a page on the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-carter.cfm">Carter Notch Hut</a>, with information on the hut,
season of operation and rates.  Here I give hiking information that
supplements what they offer, describing the most frequently used
access routes (with distances, elevation gains and <a
href="faq1.html#booktime1">book time</a>), and <i>some</i> of the
trips that can utilize the hut, including hut to hut trips.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref0" id="tocref0"></a>Carter Notch Hut in
Winter</h2>

<p>The cooking and dining areas are heated (moderately!) in winter,
but the remote bunkhouses are not. Temperatures may be expected to
be about as cold as in a tent, so a real winter bag, rated to about
-20&deg;F, is advisable.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Getting to Carter Notch Hut
and Back</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Nineteen Mile Brook
Trail</h3>

<p>The standard way of reaching the hut is by the Nineteen Mile
Brook Trail (ow: 3.8 miles, 1,900 feet, 2:50). The final climb to
the height of land is a bit steeper than the rest of trail, after
that it drops to the lakes and the hut. There is a 100 foot climb
on the way back (ow: 3.8 miles, 100 feet, 1:55).</p>

<p>In either direction it is possible to add a climb over Carter
Dome by taking the Nineteen Mile Brook, Carter Dome and
Carter-Moriah trails (ow: 6.4 miles, 3,350 feet, 4:50). While the
views from Carter Dome are good, even better views can be had from
Mount Height. This adds 0.2 miles and 150 feet, or about ten
minutes hiking time.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Wildcat Ridge Trail</h3>

<p>A second approach is going over the Wildcats (ow: 5.1 miles,
3,150 feet, 4:10). The Wildcat Ridge Trail starts on Rt 16 at the
Glenn Ellis Falls parking lot, and immediately crosses the Ellis
River, meeting the Lost Pond Trail. The climb from there to the E
peak is steep and rough, with ledges that can be dangerous if wet
or icy. The ridge itself has many ups and downs, with steep and
rough sections. The final descent from the A peak to the hut is
again steep. It is not an easy trail, especially with a full pack!
The return trip is equally rough, but with slightly less elevation
gain (ow: 5.1 miles; 1,750 feet; 3:25).</p>

<p>As the crossing of the Ellis River is sometimes difficult many
hikers start at Pinkham Notch taking the Lost Pond Trail, which
adds 0.9 miles and 100 feet, 30 minutes of hiking time. That is the
route the Appalachian Trail takes.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Wildcat River Trail</h3>

<p>This much less frequently used trail approaches the notch from
the south (ow: 4.3 miles; 1,550 feet; 2:55). It branches off the
Bog Brook Trail, which starts on the Carter Notch Road. The Bog
Brook Trail has three stream crossings that may be difficult at
high water, they can be bypassed by continuing along the extension
of Carter Notch Road (FR 233, unpaved) to the point where the Bog
Brook Trail crosses the road.</p>

<p>The Wildcat River Trail itself climbs at a moderate grade most
of the way, but becomes a bit steeper as it approaches the notch.
The return trip involves a minor climb of 50 feet on the Bog Brook
Trail (ow: 4.3 miles; 50 feet; 2:10).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Hikes From Carter Notch
Hut</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>The Wildcats</h3>

<p>The climb from the hut to the A peak of Wildcat is short but
steep (rt: 1.8 miles; 1,150 feet; 1:30). There is a viewpoint close
to the summit with excellent views of the notch. Peakbaggers may
want to go further and bag the D peak as well (6.4 miles; 2,750
feet; 4:35). Note that traversing the ridge in both directions is
quite a strenuous undertaking, as the terrain is rough and there
are many ups and downs.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>The Carters</h3>

<p>The climb to Carter Dome is as short and as steep as the climb
to Wildcat A (rt: 2.6 miles; 1,550 feet; 2:05). Carter Dome has
good views, but even better views can be had by continuing along
the Cater-Moriah Trail to Mount Height (4.2 miles; 2,000 feet;
3:05).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Routes to Neighboring
Huts</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Routes to Madison Hut</h3>

<p>The easier route is by the Nineteen Mile Brook Trail to Rt 16,
walking north on the road for about half a mile, and then taking
the Great Gulf and Osgood trails to the hut (ow: 9.4 miles; 3,950
feet; 6:40). A longer and much more strenuous way is to follow the
AT over the Wildcats to Pinkham, then take the Old Jackson Road,
Madison Gulf and Osgood Trails (13.6 miles; 5,850 feet; 9:45).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>Route to Pinkham
Notch</h3>

<p>The At can be used to return to Pinkham Notch over the Wildcats
(ow: 6.0 miles; 1,750 feet; 3:50).</p>
