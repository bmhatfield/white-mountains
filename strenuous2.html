Did you know that it is possible to go for a 16 mile hike over
rugged terrain with over 3,000 feet of elevation gain inside Rt.
128? If not you are not alone, the possibilities for serious hiking
in the <a href="strenuous.html">Blue Hills</a> and, to a lesser
extent, Middlesex Fells are one of the best kept secrets of the
Boston hiking community. These two areas offer spring training
opportunities for those whose fitness has suffered over the winter,
and can provide moderately challenging hikes for those weekends
when a trip up North is not convenient. <!--
I also find the area very convenient during the <A
HREF="http://www.greenmountainclub.org/page.php?id=60"> Mud Season</A>,
when the trails in northern New England have mud at lower elevations
and melting snow at higher elevations, leading to unpleasant hiking
and to damaging erosion of trails.

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>The Area</h2>

<p>While there are a few other rugged areas around Boston, none
offers the length and variety of trails that the Middlesex Fells
and Blue Hills offer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/fells.htm">This</a> is a large reservation on both sides of I93 north of
Boston, in the towns of Stoneham, Medford, Malden, Melrose and
Winchester
(<a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/fells.pdf n">map</a>). Most
hiking is done in the western part, and the area surrounding the
reservoirs is closed to the public.</p>

<p>The western section has a spine of hills along its eastern edge,
with flatter terrain on the western side of the reservoirs. There
are two long trails here. The Reservoir Trail (orange blazes, 5.5
miles) basically goes around the reservoirs, though never along
their shores. Much of it follows old carriage roads, and when it
becomes a footpath it is neither steep nor does it go over rugged
terrain. The Skyline Trail (white blazes, 6.8 miles) follows the
rocky eastern spine of this section above the highway, then goes
over every small hill on the generally flatter western side. It is
entirely a footpath, and has rough footing much of the time.</p>

<p>The eastern half is much less used, even though it is probably
more scenic. The Rock Circuit Trail (white blazes, 4 miles) is a
rough and rocky trail that makes a loop in the southern half of
that section. The two sections are connected by the blue blazed
Cross Fells trail.</p>

<p>There are many other trails and carriage roads, and hikers are
strongly advised to get a map of the reservation.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>The Hikes</h2>

<p>An excellent first spring hike is the Reservoir Trail (a loop of
about 5.5 miles marked by orange blazes) in the Western Fells. It
is fairly flat, and is a mixture of carriage roads and narrower
trails. It hugs the central reservoirs fairly closely, and does not
go far South of them, limiting its length. It crosses the more
challenging Skyline trail several times, so it is possible to add
one or two hills to it.</p>

<p>This can be made more strenuous in two ways. You can increase
its length by going all the way South to Bellevue Pond, and use the
more hilly Skyline Trail part of the way. In its least strenuous
form it is the Reservoir Trail plus carriage roads to and from
Bellevue Pond. At the other extreme, you can go all the way along
the Skyline Trail except for the ridge of hills between Bellevue
Pond and the Sheepfold. In any case, the full loop is about seven
miles.</p>

<p>The full Skyline Trail (a loop of about 7 miles marked by white
blazes) is rocky, with many small hills (the highest, Bear Hill, is
only 317 feet above sea level), and is quite challenging at the
beginning of the season.</p>

<p>It is easy to extend the Skyline Trail by following the blue
blazed Cross Fells Trail for about a mile into the East Fells.
There one can do the Rock Circuit Trail (white blazes) for another
four miles, giving a total of about 12 miles. One can lengthen it
further by going North on the pink blazed Virginia Woods Trail and
then the red blazed Crystal Spring Trail. This gives a hike of
around 16 miles, which is quite challenging in spite of the limited
elevation gain.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Maps</h3>

<p>The DCR web site has schematic maps of the <a
href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/fells.gif">Middlesex
Fells</a>. It is more useful for visualizing the locations of
trailheads and major features than anything else.</p>

<p>Maps of the Middlesex Fells can be obtained in the following
ways (from DCR web site):</p>

<ul>

<li> Botume House Visitors Center, Middlesex Fells Reservation, 4
Woodland Rd., Stoneham </li>

<li> Map Shack, 185 New Boston St. Woburn. </li>

<li> Best Sellers Cafe, 24 High St., Medford Square</li>


<li> Book Ends, 559 Main St., Winchester </span></li>

<li> Or order by mail. Please make out a personal check to the
Friends of Middlesex Fells Reservation for $6.00 per map.</li>

<h3><a name="tocref13" id="tocref13"></a>Books and Web Sites</h3>

<p>The AMC's <i>Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail Guide</i>,
currently in its 7<sup>th</sup> edition, has full descriptions of
all the trails in both reservations. The map of the Blue Hills
included with the book does not show contours, and so is much less
useful than the DCR map.</p>

<p>The Department of Conservation and Recreation (<a
href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/">DCR</a>) web site has some very basic
information on the <a
href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/fells.htm">Middlesex
Fells</a>.  The <a href="http:/amcboston.org/walks/">Local
Walks/Hikes</a> Committee of the Boston Chapter of the AMC runs
frequent trips in the Middlesex Fells.</p>
