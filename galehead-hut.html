Galehead Hut (elevation 3,800 feet) is in the col between Galehead
and South Twin, with views to the south over the vast Pemigewasset
Wilderness. With its strategic location at the junction of the
<a href="garfield.html">Garfield and Twin ridges</a> it can be used
for a great variety of trips. Two day trips can include, in
addition to Galehead Mountain, Mount Garfield or one or both Twins,
or possibly all three peaks. The hut can also be used as a "base
camp" for a three day (two night) trip to the
<a href="bondrts.html">Bonds</a>. It is also often combined with
Greenleaf and/or Zealand Falls huts for a traverse of the northern
rim of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. 

<p>The AMC web site has a page on the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-galehead.cfm">Galehead Hut</a>, with information on the hut,
season of operation and rates.  Here I give hiking information that
supplements what they offer, describing the most frequently used
access routes (with distances, elevation gains and <a
href="faq1.html#booktime1">book time</a>), and <i>some</i> of the
trips that can utilize the hut, including hut to hut trips.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Getting to Galehead Hut and
Back</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Gale River and Garfield
Ridge Trails</h3>

<p>The usual route to the hut is by the Gale River Trail (ow: 4.6
miles; 2,200 feet, 3:25). For the first three miles the trail
follows the North Branch of the Gale River, crossing it on a bridge
at 1.7 miles and recrossing it, on stepping stones (may be
difficult at high water) at 2.5 miles. About a half mile beyond the
second crossing the trail steepens, and there is a very steep
section going up rock steps to the junction with the Garfield Ridge
Trail. That trail leads to the hut in a little over half a mile.
The return trip is downhill all the way (ow: 4.6 miles; 2:20).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Garfield and Garfield Ridge
Trails</h3>

<p>For peakbaggers intent on bagging Mount Garfield on a Galehead
Hut trip can go up the Mount Garfield Trail to Mount Garfield, then
follow the Garfield Ridge Trail to the hut (ow: 8.1 miles; 3,700
feet; 5:55). The Mount Garfield Trail has easy grades all the way,
and the lower part goes through very pleasant open hardwoods. The
Garfield Ridge Trail is very rough and has steep sections. The
reverse trip involves a steep climb up to Mount Garfield (ow: 8.1
miles; 1,400 feet; 4:45).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>North Twin and Twinway
Trails</h3>

<p>Like all trails approaching the northern rim of the Pemi from Rt
3, the North Twin Trail starts out with gentle grades through open
hardwoods (ow: 6.4 miles; 3,450 feet; 4:55). It follows the Little
River for about two miles, crossing it three times (crossings may
be difficult at high water). Soon after the last crossing the trail
becomes steeper, and eventually reaches the summit of North Twin.
While North Twin is wooded there are two good outlooks in the
summit area. The ridge between the two peaks is quite gentle, and
South Twin has excellent 360&deg; views. The return trip involves a
very steep climb from the hut to the summit of South Twin (ow: 6.4
miles, 1,450 feet; 3:55).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Hikes from Galehead Hut</h2>

<p>Peakbaggers with two cars may want to go up one trail and down
another, to bag multiple peaks. An easy way would be to go up the
Gale River Trail the first day, bagging Galehead Mountain later
that day. Next day descend either over Mount Garfield or over the
Twins. A more ambitious approach would be to go over Garfield on
the way up, and over the Twins on the way down (or <i>vice
versa</i>).</p>

<p>Below I describe trips suitable for those with only one car. I
assume a one night stay at the hut, except for the Bonds trip,
where I assume that most people will want to stay at the hut both
before and after the trip.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Galehead Mountain</h3>

<p>The Frost Trail starts near the hut, and goes to the viewless
summit at a moderate grade (rt: 1.0 mile; 250 feet; 0:40). Galehead
is the kind of summit only a peakbagger would visit, a cairn
surrounded by trees with only a moderately good outlook on the way
up!</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>South Twin</h3>

<p>A short but <i>very</i> steep climb rewarded with some of the
best views in the Whites (rt: 1.6 miles; 1,150 feet; 1:20). South
Twin in the most northerly of a series of summits stretching over
Guyot, Bond and Bondcliff with 360&deg; views into the Pemigewasset
Wilderness. Peakbaggers with only one car may want to lengthen the
trip to include North Twin (rt: 3.2 miles; 1,900 feet; 2:30), those
with two cars may prefer to do a loop.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Mount Garfield</h3>

<p>Peakbaggers with only one car can make a side trip on the
Garfield Ridge Trail to the summit of Mount Garfield, preferably on
the way down. The trail is steep and rocky (rt: 5.0 miles; 1,700
feet; 3:20). It is probably easier, after reaching the summit of
Mount Garfield, to return by the Mount Garfield Trail and walk
along the road to your car.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>The Bonds</h3>

<p>This is a spectacular trip in good weather, going up the Twinway
from the hut to S. Twin, then down over Guyot to either Bond and
West Bond, or over all three. The climb up to S. Twin from the hut
is very steep, the climb back from Guyot is much easier. The round
trip to Bond and West Bond is 9.2 miles with 2,950 feet of
elevation gain, book time 6:05, while adding Bondcliff makes it
11.6 miles with 3,600 feet of elevation gain with a book time of
7:35.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>Routes to Neighboring
Huts</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Routes to Greenleaf
Hut</h3>

<p>There is only one way of going from Galehead Hut to
<a href="greenleaf-hut.html">Greenleaf Hut</a>. Take the Garfield
Ridge Trail, with its many ups and downs, over Mount Garfield (and
many smaller bumps) to the summit of Mount Lafayette, then take the
Greenleaf Trail down to the hut (ow: 7.7 miles; 3,450 feet; 5:50).
The Garfield Ridge Trail is notorious for being steep and rocky,
and to be more difficult than the numbers might indicate.</p>

<p>The last mile of the Garfield Ridge Trail as well as the entire
mile on the Greenleaf Trail are above treeline, with excellent
views but great exposure to the weather.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>Routes to Zealand Hut</h3>

<p>The Twinway goes from Galehead Hut to
<a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand Hut</a> (ow: 7.0 miles; 1,750
feet; 4:25). After a very steep climb to the summit of South Twin
it goes mostly downhill, with a minimal climb up to the summit of
Guyot, and a short but steep climb up to Zealand Mountain. There
are 360&deg; views from the summits of South Twin and Guyot, and
excellent, though partial, views from Zeacliff.</p>

<p>Peakbaggers will get both South Twin and Zealand Mountain this
way. They can add North Twin for an additional 2.6 miles and 750
feet. Alternately, they can swing to the south and do West Bond and
Bond, adding 3.6 miles and 1,000 feet (including a steep climb up
Bond!). The really motivated can add Bondcliff to the trip, for a
total of 13 miles and 3,400 feet, with a book time of 8:10.</p>
