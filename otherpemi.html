<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.09361&lon=-71.4469&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC operates one <a href="amc-huts.html">hut</a> and one
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsite</a> in this area of the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
Fees are charged at all of them, reservations are advised at the
huts, but there are no reservations at the campsites.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand Falls Hut</a> is located
near the junction of the Twinway and Zealand trails [ow: 2.8 miles,
650 feet, 1:45]. A longer approach is from Crawford Notch by the
Avalon and A-Z trails [ow: 5.5 miles, 2,000 feet, 3:45]. It is
mainly used by peakbaggers in conjunction with other huts for
multi-day traverses, since it is too close to the road to be of
much use alone.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>The Ethan Pond campsite is reached by the Ethan Pond trail [ow:
2.6 miles, 1,450 feet, 2:00]. It has a shelter plus 3 single and 3
double platforms. It is mainly used for backcountry camping, and is
of little interest to peakbaggers.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Routes</h2>

<h3><a name="Owl" id="Owl"></a>Owl's Head</h3>

<p>This is a long trip, but the elevation gain is moderate, so it
is commonly done in one day. The standard way to do it is by the
Wilderness, Franconia Brook and Lincoln Brook trails to the foot of
the Owlshead slide, and follow an unofficially maintained trail to
the summit (rt: 18 miles, 2,850 feet, 10:25). This involves
crossing Franconia and Lincoln Brooks, both crossings can be
difficult. For those comfortable navigating with map and compass
the <i>White Mountain Guide</i> suggests a couple of bushwhacks,
which save about one mile each way in addition to avoiding the
crossings.</p>

<p>Those desiring to do that route in two days can camp in the valley
of the Lincoln Brook. This is a Federally designated Wilderness Area,
please be sure to follow the <a
href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/recreation/camping/2010_backcountry_rules_web.pdf">
Forest Service camping rules</a>. An alternate, longer, way to do it
as an overnight is to camp at 13 Falls campsite (ow: 8.1 miles, 1,050
feet, 4:35) on the first day. On the second day take the Lincoln Brook
trail around the North end of Owl's Head to the slide, go to the
summit and back, and continue out by the Lincoln Brook, Franconia
Brook and Wilderness trails (ow: 12.5 miles, 2,500 feet, 7:30).</p>

<p>Another (long!) way of doing Owlshead as an overnight trip is to
take the Gale River trail to Galehead hut on the first day (ow: 4.6
miles, 2,200 feet, 3:25). Next day go down the Twin Brook Trail to
13 Falls campsite and take the Lincoln Brook trail as described
above (ow: 16.2 miles; 2,500 feet; 9:20).</p>

<h3><a name="Carrigain" id="Carrigain"></a>Mount Carrigain</h3>

<p>The standard route is by the Signal Ridge trail (rt: 10 miles,
3,250 feet, 6:40). In addition to the views from the observation
tower at the summit (amongst the finest in the Whites) there are
excellent views along the ridge. A loop can be made by ascending by
the Signal Ridge trail and descending by the Desolation, Carrigain
Notch and Signal Ridge trails (lp: 13.5 miles, 3,650 feet, 8:35),
this is not only longer, but the Desolation Trail is steep and
rough. <b>NOTE</b>: The Sawyer River Road, which provides access to
the trailhead, has been reopened.</p>

<h3><a name="Hancocks" id="Hancocks"></a>The Hancocks</h3>

<p>North and South Hancock are climbed by the Hancock Notch, Cedar
Brook and Hancock Loop trails (lp: 9.8 miles, 2,650 feet, 6:15).
There are several stream crossings which may be difficult, and the
Hancock Loop trail is very steep and eroded.</p>

<h3><a name="Hale" id="Hale"></a>Mount Hale</h3>

<p>The standard route is by the Hale Brook Trail (rt: 4.4 miles,
2,300 feet, 3:20). Many lengthen the trip by making a loop using
the Hale Brook, Lend a Hand and Zealand trails (lp: 7.7 miles,
2,300 feet, 5:00). With only one car add a mile of road walk.</p>

<p>Mount Hale can also be done from Zealand Falls Hut. It can be
done as a round trip, returning to the hut, using the Lend a Hand
Trail (rt: 5.6 miles; 1,350 feet; 3:30). It can also be used to
leave the hut, going up the Lend a Hand Trail and down the Hale
Brook Trail (ow: 5.0 miles; 1,350 feet; 3:10). Going to the hut
over Mt. Hale will add 950 feet (0:30) to the trip.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to the peaks discussed on this
page.</p>
