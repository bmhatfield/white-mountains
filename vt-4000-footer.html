<p>The five Vermont 4,000 footers are all on the Long Trail (LT),
and close enough to the roads that they can all be easily done as
day trips. Mounts Ellen and Abraham are often combined in a single
hike over both summits, while the other three are almost always
done separately.</p>


<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The National Weather Service in Burlington, VT, has a forecast for
<a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/">the Higher Summits
of Vermont and Northern New York</a> as well as a point
forecasts for <a
href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/point/KILLINGTON.txt">Killington
Peak</a> and <a
href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/mountain/point/ELLEN.txt">Mount Ellen</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Killington Peak</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy, you may want to look at
a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4832208&amp;e=674727&amp;s=100&amp;size=l&amp;datum=nad83&amp;layer=DRG100">
Topozone map</a> of the area.</p>

<p>There are two common approaches to Killington. The shorter (rt:
7.2 miles; 2,500 feet; 4:50) is from the West, from Brewer's
Corner, and follows the <b>Bucklin Trail</b> to its junction with
the Long Trail near Cooper Lodge. From here the Killington Spur
climbs steeply to the summit.</p>

<p>A longer approach, doing both Killington and Pico Peak
(elevation 3,957 feet,a peak on the
<a href="ne-hundred-highest.html">New England 100 Highest
list</a>), is from Sherburne Pass on Rt 4. Take the old route of
the LT (now called the <b>Sherburne Trail</b>) to Pico Camp, then
up and down the <b>Pico Spur</b>, then continue on the LT to Cooper
Lodge, and go up and down the <b>Killington Spur</b>. With only one
car you have to return the same way (rt: 12.0 miles; 2,650 feet;
7:20), with two cars you can descend by the Bucklin trail (lp: 9.6
miles, 2,650 feet, 6:10).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Mount Abraham and Mount
Ellen</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy, you may want to look (in
a separate window) at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4889286&amp;e=665603&amp;s=100&amp;size=l&amp;datum=nad83&amp;layer=drg100">
Topozone map</a> of the area.</p>

<p>These two summits are 3.7 miles apart on the "Monroe Skyline"
section of the LT. They are close enough to be done together,
though they can, of course, be done separately. They can be
approached from where the AT crosses roads in Lincoln Gap (south of
Mt. Abraham) or Appalachian Gap (north of Mt. Ellen), or from side
trails on the west slopes of the mountains. When doing one peak
alone it is usual do do a round trip, there is little reason to use
two trails and do a car spot. Doing both together requires two cars
or the willingness to thumb a rids back!</p>

<p>The summit of Mount Abraham is one of the three areas in Vermont
with alpine vegetation, so please be careful! The other two are
Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Mt. Abraham Alone</h3>

<p>Mount Abraham can be done alone in two ways, both quite short.
It may be approached from Lincoln Gap (elevation 2,424 feet) along
the LT (rt: 5.2 miles; 1,600 feet; 3:25), note that the road
through Lincoln Gap is not plowed in winter. An approach with more
elevation gain uses the <b>Battell Trail</b> then the LT (rt: 5.8
miles; 2,500 feet; 4:10).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Mt. Ellen Alone</h3>

<p>Mount Ellen can also be approached via the LT from Appalachian
Gap (elevation 2,365 feet), but this route involves more elevation
gain than the trailhead elevation suggests, as it goes over General
Stark Mountain, then drops to the Glen Ellen Lodge before climbing
up to Mount Ellen (rt: 10.6 miles; 2,200 feet; 6:25). Alternately
it can be approached via the <b>Jerusalem Trail</b> (rt: 8.6 miles;
2,600 feet; 5:35).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Mt. Abraham and Mt.
Ellen</h3>

<p>Doing both peaks will give you the opportunity to do part or all
of the Monroe Skyline along the ridge. To quote the <i>Hiker's
Guide to the Mountains of Vermont</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Although the ridge is generally densely wooded, the trail itself
is challenging, and there are enough viewpoints to make this a very
worthwhile excursion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With four trailheads there are a large number of potential
routes, I will describe a few of them. Most require two cars or the
willingness to thumb a ride back to the starting point, but I have
just added a single car route..</p>

<p>The most obvious way is to follow the LT from Lincoln to
Appalachian Gaps (lp: 11.6 miles; 2,500 feet; 7:00, same in reverse
direction). This goes over both peaks, plus Lincoln Peak and
General Stark Mountain.</p>

<p>Another way is to start from Lincoln Gap but use the Jerusalem
Trail to go down (lp: 10.5 miles; 2,300 feet; 6:25), avoiding the
rather rough climb over General Stark Mountain. Starting at
Appalachian Gap and exiting by the Battell Trail is another
possibility (lp: 11.8 miles; 2,500 feet; 7:10).</p>

<p>With one car the easiest way is a round trip from Lincoln Gap to
Mt. Ellen and back along the Long Trail (rt: 12.6 miles; 1,600
feet; 7:05).</p>

<p>Note that in all cases I suggest starting at one of the gaps,
this saves about 1,000 feet of elevation gain!</p>

<h2><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Resources</h2>

<p>The official guidebook is the <i>Long Trail Guide</i> published
by the Green Mountain Club (GMC). This is a much less detailed
guide than the <i>White Mountain Guide</i>, and does not give the
elevations of trailheads. The maps that come with it are not very
detailed, though there is a more detailed map of Mount Mansfield
and Camels Hump. Map Adventures publishes a pair of maps that are a
very useful supplement to those in the guide. The first is the
<i>Northern Vermont Hiking Trails</i>, which covers Mt. Mansfield,
Camel's Hump and more. The second is <i>Vermont and New Hampshire
Hiking</i>, which covers Killington, Abraham and Ellen, as well as
other areas. The GMC also publishes a <i>Trail Map of Mt.
Mansfield</i> separate from the guidebook.</p>

<p>All the Vermont Fours are covered in the <i>Long Trail
Guide</i>, but several of the peaks on the NE 100 Highest list are
not. These will be found described in the <i>Day Hiker's Guide to
Vermont</i>, also published by the GMC.</p>

<p>In addition to the two official guidebooks there are a large
number of other books, the one I use is the <i>Hiker's Guide to the
Mountains of Vermont</i> by Jared Gange, a slim volume that covers
most of the routes described here.</p>
