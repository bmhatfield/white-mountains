<h1>Peakbagging:  A Personal Perspective</h1>

<p>I will try to explain why I started peakbagging with great
enthusiasm, and now have almost completely lost interest in non-winter
peakbagging.  In the process of trying to understand why that happened
I have tentatively concluded that there are two distinct sub-species
of <i>Homo peakbaggerensis</i>, the <i>Achievers</i> and the
<i>Collectors</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after starting to hike in the Whites in the spring of 1997
I befriended many Boston Chapter trip leaders, and many of them were
working on either the NH Fours or the NE Hundred Highest.  At that
time the NH Fours seemed like a reasonable goal, both challenging and
attainable.  By the end of the summer of 1998 I had finished both the
NH and VT Fours, and made a start on the Hundred Highest, so it seemed
natural to aim at that list.</p>

<p>Late in the summer of 1999 it was clear that I would soon finish
the NE Hundred Highest list, and I automatically started thinking
"What next?".  One trip to the Adirondacks was enough to persuade me
that they were too far, so I started thinking about the NH Hundred
Highest.  In late October of that year I did the Garfield Ridge Peaks,
and in early December I did the two Huntingtons that are on the
Hundred Highest list.</p>

<p>But when the summer of 2000 came around I found that I had little
enthusiasm for that list.  I did bag the Longs and Clough on a
peakbagging expedition, and the Baldfaces as part of a very pleasant
backpack into the Wild River Valley, but that was it.  Other goals had
no greater appeal: some friends suggested that I bag the NH Fours in
every season, others suggested redlining, but I was unable to feel any
enthusiasm for any of these goals.  Initially I asked myself why I had
lost all interest in peakbagging (note that I continued hiking every
weekend), then I started asking myself why I had started bagging peaks
in the first place.</p>

<p>Looking back I believe that I had a twofold motivation.  I wanted
to have the "hiking credentials" that completion of the lists would
confer on me, more to deal with my own insecurities than to impress
anyone else.  I also wanted to get to know the many peaks that my
companions spoke about.  The Hundred Highest seemed a reasonable
extension of the initial goal, they required bushwhacking skills, and
made me visit areas, such as Northern Maine, that I would not
otherwise have visited.</p>

<p>Once I achieved that goal I felt that none of the potential further
goals contained a real challenge.  I had proved that I could
bushwhack, doing more peaks would add nothing.  And while the NH
Hundred Highest would have led me to parts of the Great North Woods
that I am not familiar with, that did not seem a compelling reason to
invest much time in driving long distances to climb viewless peaks.</p>

<p>I believe that many peakbaggers have a similar motivation.  At some
stage they hear of the NH Fours, and set out to do them recording each
peak at the back of their WMG.  When they finish the list most are
through with peakbagging (but, in most cases, not with hiking).  I
will call this group the Achievers, as they set out to achieve a goal,
and having achieved it move on to other things.</p>

<p>The other group consists of those who keep on bagging peaks, either
doing new lists or repeating the old ones.  I will call these the
Collectors, as they keep collecting peaks.</p>

<p>Collectors differ in what they collect.  Some merely redo the NH
Fours, counting the number of times they have finished the list.  A
few attempt to do them every year.  Others, who hike year round, try
to do every peak in each of the four seasons.  Years ago Gene Daniell
did them in every month, recently Ed Hawkins has duplicated this feat,
and a few others are working on it.</p>

<p>Another group of collectors collects lists.  There are a large
number of lists that are not as well known as the NH Fours.  Two are
officially maintained by the Four Thousand Footer Committee, the New
England Fours and the New England Hundred Highest.  Unofficial lists
exist of the New Hampshire Hundred Highest, and of the 3,000 footers
in each of the New England states.  For those who want to go beyond
New England there are the Adirondacks 4,000 footers.  Any of these
lists may be done in winter.  So collectors certainly have a lot of
peaks that they can collect!</p>

<p>I am not a collector.  I am interested in climbing most major peaks
by most of the interesting routes.  On the other hand, I have no
interest at all in climbing all the routes.  I hope to climb the Fours
many, many times, but have no interest in counting how many times.  I
climb year round, but have no interest in recording which peak I
climbed in which season.</p>

<p>The situation in winter is very different.  In summer adding the
Maine and Vermont Fours to their NH brethren is not much of an
achievement.  In winter even the peaks in the Rangeley and Stratton
areas seem dauntingly remote, while going to Baxter State Park is a
major adventure.  Need I add that doing the NE Hundred Highest in
winter is a major escalation?  I have no interest in doing the
Adirondack peaks in summer, as I see no real achievement that would
justify the long drives.  But from all that I have heard doing them in
winter is substantially more difficult than doing our White Mountain
peaks.</p>

<p> So, while I am probably not going to finish any further all
seasons lists, I am still full of enthusiasm for the winter lists.  I
had hoped to finish the NH Fours this past (2002-2003) winter, but was
unable to do Mount Jefferson because of my lack of fitness.  I have
already bagged all the Vermont peaks (in many cases the drive took
longer than the hike), and have bagged a few of the more accessible
ones in Maine.  In March 2002 I went to Baxter State Park to attempt
the Brothers, Fort and Coe, and succeeded in doing North Brother and
Fort.  I returned in the winter of 2003 to attempt South Brother and
Coe, and only succeeded in getting the former.  Then on to Katahdin in
winter, which is a much more difficult proposition.</p>

<p>And in the winter of 2002-2003 I started a new spreadsheet,
recording how many times I had bagged each peak in winter.  Multiple
peakbagging in summer does not strike me as much of an achievement,
but doing the entire list two or more times in winter seems much more
challenging!</p>
