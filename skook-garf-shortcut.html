<h1>Shortcut Between Garfield Trail and Skookumchuck Trailhead</h1>

<div id="main">


<p>An ambitious hiker can climb Mounts Lafayette and Garfield by
taking the Skookumchuck Trail to the Garfield Ridge Trail, then going
up to Lafayette, turning around and following the Garfield Ridge Trail
to the summit of Mount Garfield, descending by the Garfield Trail. It
is an ambitious hike (13.6 miles; 4,850 feet; 9:15), but doable by
strong hikers with two cars.</p>

<p>Having previously explored the logging roads (some are used as
snowmobile trails) between the <a
href="gale-garf-shortcut.html">Garfield Trail and Gale River
trailhead</a> I was curious to see whether something similar could be
done between the Garfield Trail and the Skookumchuck trailhead.</p>

<p>There is a logging road (at one time it was maintained as a
snowmobile trail) that crosses the Garfield Trail between the upper
and middle stream crossings. It is familiar to some as a way of
avoiding the stream crossings at high water. Take it westwards, it
soon passes over one of the bridges used in the bypass, and continues
for about half a mile more or less due west to the site of the old
Bethlehem Reservoir (shown on maps). Here it heads south for another
half mile, approaching the South Branch of the Gale River. The bridge
that used to cross the river is gone, and while the crossing was easy
in mid-summer after a dry spell it may well be difficult at high
water.</p>

<p>After the crossing the trail rises sharply for a short distance,
then makes a sharp turn and descends gently. After about half a mile
it ends on the current snowmobile trail (Corridor 11) which rises to
the south at a moderate pitch. It then turns west and follows the
contour in an area with much evidence of logging (clearings, several
logging roads intersect the snowmobile trail). About half a mile west
of Scarface Brook there is a junction, where the official snowmobile
trail makes a right angled turn to the right (north, downhill) while an
old but still easy to follow logging road continues straight
ahead. Either road can be taken; the snowmobile trail has less growth,
the old road is shorter and goes straight down. The
snowmobile trail then starts to lose elevation, but with many minor
ups and downs that do not show on the map but that your legs will
feel. It ultimately crosses the Skookumchuck Trail a short distance
above the trailhead.</p>

<p>The logging roads that are not part of the official Corridor 11 are
currently in fairly good condition, with a few large blowdowns that
are easy to deal with. There is a lot of fallen wood on the ground,
and that will obviously increase as the years go by.</p>

<p>I estimate the distance on the logging roads to be about four or
five miles, with a bit over 500 feet of elevation gain. In exchange
you save the last mile or so of the Garfield Trail. It is a
non-trivial addition to what is already a long hike!</p>

<p>The map below shows the Corridor 11 snowmobile trail in blue, with
the older logging road segments in red.</p>
