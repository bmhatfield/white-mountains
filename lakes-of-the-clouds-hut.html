<p>Lakes Of The Clouds Hut (elevation 5,012) is the highest of the
huts, and also the largest and most popular. Given its spectacular
setting at the base of Mount Washington, the latter is hardly
surprising.</p>

<p>It can be reached by hiking <i>up</i> from the valleys, or by
taking the road or cog rail to the summit of Mt. Washington and
hiking <i>down</i>. Many of those who choose the second alternative
seem to forget that they will have to hike back up to get their
transportation off the mountain!</p>

<p>This hut can be used for an overnight trip to Mts. Washington
and Monroe, or as part of a three day (two night) hut based
traverse of the Presidential Range.</p>

<p>The AMC web site has a page on the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-lakes.cfm">Lakes Of The Clouds Hut</a>, with information on the hut,
season of operation and rates.  Here I give hiking information that
supplements what they offer, describing the most frequently used
access routes (with distances, elevation gains and <a
href="faq1.html#booktime1">book time</a>), and <i>some</i> of the
trips that can utilize the hut, including hut to hut trips.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Getting to Lakes Of The
Clouds Hut and Back</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail</h3>

<p>The shortest route, and the one with the least elevation gain,
is by the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail (ow: 3.1 miles; 2,500 feet;
2:50). The trail is definitely not as easy as the numbers seem to
imply. Above Gem Pool is a very steep section, it has reasonably
good footing but is nevertheless aerobically challenging. This is
followed by a less steep section that goes over many open ledges,
which can be slippery when wet or icy. Starting at these ledges the
trail has some fine views.</p>

<p>The trail is in the trees almost to the hut, as a result it is
the least exposed to the elements, and is the best way to leave the
hut in bad weather.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Ammonoosuc Ravine and Jewell
Trail Loop</h3>

<p>A very popular loop trip to Lakes Hut is done by going up the
Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail on the first day. On the second day climb
Mount Washington by the Crawford Path, and return to the trailhead
by the Jewell Trail (ow: 6.6 miles; 1,200 feet; 3:55). This trip
does not return to the hut, so hikers must carry all their
belongings up to the summit of Mount Washington on the second
day.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Tuckerman's Ravine
Trail</h3>

<p>This route (ow: 4.6 miles; 3,450 feet; 4:00) is more strenuous
and more exposed than the one by the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail, but
also much more scenic.</p>

<p>The first two miles to the Hermit Lake Shelter follow a tractor
road that is wide and moderately (but constantly!) steep. This is
in the trees with only occasional views. From Hermit Lake on it is
above the trees, with excellent views and corresponding exposure.
First it ascends moderately to the floor of the ravine, then it
ascends, much more steeply, up the headwall.</p>

<p>At the top of the headwall the trail reaches Tuckerman Junction,
where the Tuckerman Crossover Trail leads to the hut across the
Bigelow Lawn.</p>

<p>Taking the more scenic (and more strenuous) Lion's Head Trail
adds about 0.3 miles and no extra elevation gain.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Crawford Path</h3>

<p>This is a much longer route (ow: 7.0 miles; 3,450 feet; 5:15),
though the grades are gentle almost the whole way. There are a few
areas of scrub between Mount Pierce (formerly Clinton) and Mount
Eisenhower, beyond the latter the trail is continuously exposed. In
good weather that makes a spectacular trip. The reverse trip has
little elevation gain (ow: 7.0 miles, 350 feet, 3:40).</p>

<p>Crawfords Path bypasses all of the summits, for Mount Pierce add
about 0.2 miles with 100 feet of elevation gain (0:10), while Mount
Eisenhower and Mount Monroe each add about 0.1 mile and 350 feet
(0:15).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>From the Mount Washington
Summit</h3>

<p>Many visitors who reach the summit of Mount Washington by car
visit the hut and the area around it. The trip down is 1.5 miles
each way, with 1,300 feet of elevation gain on the way back up
(0:45 down; 1:25 up). For those not used to serious hiking the trip
back up may be more challenging than anticipated.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Hikes From Lakes Of The
Clouds Hut</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Mount Monroe</h3>

<p>This is a short trip (rt: 0.8 miles; 350 feet; 0:35) that is
often done after arriving at the hut and settling down, or after
dinner.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Mount Washington</h3>

<p>The easiest way of climbing Mount Washington is as a two day
trip, with a night spent at the Lakes Hut. The Crawford Path to the
summit (rt: 3.0 miles; 1,300 feet; 2:10) is a good trail, with
reasonable footing and grades. It is, of course, totally exposed to
the elements, but when the weather is good the views are
exceptional.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>Routes to Neighboring
Huts</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Routes to Mizpah Hut</h3>

<p>Follow the Crawford Path from Lakes Hut to the Webster Cliff
Trail, then follow that trail to Mizpah Hut (ow: 4.8 miles; 350
feet; 2:35). This bypasses the summits of Mount Eisenhower and
Mount Monroe, each of them add about 0.1 miles and 350 feet (about
0:15 hiking time).</p>

<p>From Lakes Hut to the section that bypasses Mt. Eisenhower the
trail is completely exposed; from there to the summit of mt. Pierce
there are patches of scrub, while the final section is in the
trees. In good weather the views are spectacular, but in bad
weather it can be dangerous.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>Routes to Madison Spring
Hut</h3>

<p>The easiest route to Madison Spring Hut is to follow the
Crawford Path about two thirds of the way up the cone of Mount
Washington, then bypass the summit by taking the Westside Trail to
its junction with the Gulfside Trail. Then follow the Gulfside
Trail to its end at Madison Hut (ow: 6.8 miles; 1,650 feet;
4:15).</p>

<p>This bypasses all the summits. Going over Mount Washington adds
0.7 miles and 650 feet (0:40). The loops over Mts. Clay and
Jefferson add little distance and about 300 feet each (0:10), while
going up Mt. Adams by Lowes Path and descending by the Airline
Trail adds 0.4 miles and 300 feet (0:20). Going over all the
summits adds 1.1 miles and 1,550 feet (1:20), almost doubling the
total elevation gain.</p>
