Did you know that it is possible to go for a 16 mile hike over
rugged terrain with over 3,000 feet of elevation gain inside Rt.
128? If not you are not alone, the possibilities for serious hiking
in the Blue Hills and, to a lesser extent,
<a href="strenuous2.html">Middlesex Fells</a> are one of the best
kept secrets of the Boston hiking community. These two areas offer
spring training opportunities for those whose fitness has suffered
over the winter, and can provide moderately challenging hikes for
those weekends when a trip up North is not convenient. <!--
I also find the area very convenient during the <A
HREF="http://www.greenmountainclub.org/page.php?id=60"> Mud Season</A>,
when the trails in northern New England have mud at lower elevations
and melting snow at higher elevations, leading to unpleasant hiking
and to damaging erosion of trails.
-->

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>The Area</h2>

<p>While there are a few other rugged areas around Boston, none
offers the length and variety of trails that the Middlesex Fells
and Blue Hills offer.</p>

<p>This <a
href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/blue.htm">7000 acre
reservation</a> is located south of Boston in the towns of Milton,
Canton, Randolph, Braintree, Dedham and Quincy (<a
href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/blue.pdf">map</a>). Few
hikers venture into the areas south of Rt 128 (Ponkapoag Pond section)
or west of Rt 138 (Little Blue Hill section), so I will say nothing
about them.</p>

<p>There are more than 125 miles of carriage roads and trails in
the reservation, I will only describe those that I find most
suitable for rugged hiking. Get the map and explore the others!</p>

<p>In the Great Blue Hill section, between Rt 138 and Hillside
Street, I use two trails. <!--
though I will strongly recommend a third one.  
-->
Almost everyone goes from the Rt. 138 trailhead parking to the
summit of Great Blue Hill using the right (south) branch of the red
dot trail (blazed with red dots). The Skyline Trail has two
branches going from the summit of Great Blue to Hillside Street,
together they make a loop. <!--
I prefer another, more rugged, way of
getting to the summit of Great Blue.  Go up the red dot trail until
you see the ski slopes, then head right (south), past the ski area
base station, across a slope (there is a clear, well worn path) to the
Accord Trail.  Follow that path as it parallels Rt 138 until it
crosses the blue blazed Skyline Trail, which ascends from Rt 138.
-->
</p>

<p>In the Houghton Pond section, between Hillside Street and Rt 28,
there are again two main trails that I use. The Skyline Trail goes
directly across this section, over the summits of Tucker and Buck
Hills. The orange blazed Massachuseuck Trail goes round Houghton
Pond, then winds around the sides of Tucker, Boyce and Buck Hills,
joining the Skyline Trail shortly before they both reach Rt 28.</p>

<p>In the Chickatawbut section, between Rt 28 and Chickatawbut Road
I use segments of several trails. The Skyline Trail goes across
that section over the summits of Chickatawbut, Kitchamakin,
Nahanton and the Broken Hills. The Bouncing Brook Trail follows a
carriage road south of the Skyline Trail. I use a variety of trails
that connect them to make loops.</p>

<p>In the section east of Chickatawbut Road I normally stick to the
Skyline Trail in both directions, not attempting to make a
loop.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>The Hikes</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Traverses</h3>

<p>The classic here is the Skyline Trail (blue blazes), from Quincy
going West via Houghton's Pond to the summit of Great Blue Hill,
and back to Houghton's Pond. This is about nine miles long, with an
elevation gain (my calculations, people disagree about the numbers)
of 2,500 feet. The Local Walks/Hikes Committee of the Boston
Chapter of the AMC does that hike several times a year.</p>

<p>A variation is to continue West from the summit of Great Blue
Hill, through the Little Blue Hill section of the reservation, to
the Fowl Meadow Reservation, and follow Burma Road to the Neponset
Valley Parkway. There are no big hills in the Little Blue Hill
section, and Burma Road is totally flat. I have done that hike
once, and have no desire to repeat it!</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Round Trips</h3>

<p>Since both of these require a car at each end they are not very
suitable for the individual hiker. It is possible to devise a
variety of circular hikes of similar length and elevation gain.
Since the largest single elevation gain in the Blue Hills is the
climb from the Trailside Museum to the top of Great Blue Hill I
usually start my hikes from there, though early in the season I
often do the loop from Hillside Street to Quincy because it has
less elevation gain per mile.</p>

<p>The simplest way is to head east along the Skyline Trail as far
as you want to go, then return the same way. In the table below I
give the distances and elevation gains of some round trips.</p>
<br />

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Loops</h3>

<p>I find it more interesting to do loop hikes, they are a bit
longer, with a bit less elevation gain, than the straight out and
back trips along the Skyline Trail.</p>

<p>A good base hike (about ten miles and 2,100 feet) can be done
from the Trailside Museum on Route 138. Start by taking the red dot
trail from the Trailside Museum to the summit of Great Blue Hill.
Then continue East along the South Skyline trail to the summit of
Houghton's Hill. Leave the Skyline trail, heading South (right) to
Houghton's Pond. Follow the shore of the pond (either the North or
the South shore, the latter is slightly longer) to the orange
blazed Massachuseuck Trail. Follow it, first North and then East,
along the sides of Tucker and Buck Hills. On the East slope of Buck
Hill (just above Rt 28) you will meet the Skyline Trail, head back
West (left) over the summits of Buck and Tucker Hills to Hillside
Street. Then go over Hancock, Hemmenway and Wolcott Hills to Great
Blue Hill and back to the start.</p>

<p>You can add about a mile and 300 feet elevation gain by
continuing eastwards a bit further. When the Massachuseuck Trail
intersects the Skyline Trail continue East on the Skyline Trail,
crossing Randolph Avenue, and climb to the summit of Chickatawbut
Hill. Descend until you reach the red blazed Slide Notch Path and
follow it down (South, right) to the Bouncing Brook Path, then turn
West (right again) to reach the Skyline Trail.</p>

<p>Instead of taking the Slide Notch Path you can continue on the
Skyline Trail eastbound a bit further, going over Kitchamakin Hill
to the Sassaman Notch Path (also red blazed) which also leads to
the Bouncing Brook Path. You can go even further East on the
Skyline, over Nahanton Hill to the Blue Hill Reservoir, and take
the Squamaug Notch Path to the Bouncing Brook Path. Should you
really wish to exert yourself, you could climb back up Chickatawbut
Hill on the return trip, going up either the Slide Notch or the
Sassaman Notch paths. The loop from Trailside to the reservoir and
back, including climbing Chickatawbut on the way back, is about 14
miles with an elevation gain of 2,800 feet.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9a" id="tocref9a"></a>Miscellaneous Notes</h3>

<p>Most people use the Red Dot Trail to climb from the Trailside
Museum to the summit of Big Blue. A longer route, with a steep and
rugged section, is to go past the base lodge and follow a worn path
that leads across a ski slope to the Accord Path as it enters the
trees. The Accord Path joins the Skyline Trail as it climbs from Rt
138, and offers a very rugged approach to the summit of Big Blue.
This adds about half a mile with no change in elevation gain.</p>

<p>Good lunch spots are the summits of Hancock and Buck Hills,
Nahanton, the final summit of the Broken Hills just west of
Chickatawbut Road, Rattlesnake Hill and Babel Hill.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>For More Information</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Maps</h3>

<p>The DCR web site has a schematic map of the
<a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/blueHills.gif">Blue Hills</a>.
It is more useful for visualizing the locations of trailheads and
major features than anything else.</p>

<p>There is a good topographic map, with trails, of the Blue Hills
on sale both at the Trailside Museum (on Rt 138) and the
Reservation Headquarters (on Hillside Street).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>Directions</h3>
<b>MBTA:</b><br />
<b>West area-</b>Red Line to Ashmont Station, high speed line to
Mattapan, take Canton and Blue Hills bus to Trailside Museum. For
Houghton's Pond area, stay on the bus and exit at Hillside Street
at Howard Johnson's. Cross at light and walk one mile east on
Hillside.<br />
<b>Central area-</b>Red Line to Ashmont, take MBTA bus #240 or
Chickatawbut Overlook is one mile east, Houghton's Pond is two
miles west on Chickatawbut Road.<br />
<b>East area-</b>Red Line to Quincy Center, take MBTA bus #238,
exit at West and Willard Streets across from the skating rink,
cross rink parking lot to St. Moritz Nature Trail. 

<p><b>By Car:</b><br />
<b>Houghton's Pond</b>. Rt. 128 to Exit 3, turn right at stop sign
onto Hillside Street. Houghton's Pond is approximately one mile on
the right. Or continue to reservation headquarters on the left next
to the DCR stables.<br />
<b>Trailside Museum</b> From route 128 take Exit 2 (route 138 N)
towards Milton, less than one mile on right.<br />
<b>Shea Rink</b> on Willard Street, Quincy. From route 93 take exit
8, go South on Willard Street to rink, or from route 128 take exit
6 and go North on Willard Street.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref13" id="tocref13"></a>Books and Web Sites</h3>

<p>The AMC's <i>Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail Guide</i>,
currently in its 7<sup>th</sup> edition, has full descriptions of
all the trails in both reservations. The map of the Blue Hills
included with the book does not show contours, and so is much less
useful than the DCR map.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan District Commission
(<a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/">DCR</a>) web site has some
very basic information on the
<a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/blue.htm">Blue Hills</a>.  The <a href="http://amcboston.org/walks/">Local
Walks/Hikes</a> Committee of the Boston Chapter of the AMC runs
frequent trips in the Blue Hills.</p>
