<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>The <a href="washington.html#Warning">warnings</a> about weather
and strenuousness given for Mount Washington are just as applicable
to the Northern Peaks.</p>

<p>You may want to look at the <a href="npresi.html">Northern
Presidentials</a> page for information on the huts and campsites in
the areas, and for hikes that include Mt. Adams and Mt.
Jefferson.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The best forecast for Mount Washington and its neighbors is the

forecast for <a

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Routes to Mount Madison</h2>

<p>The most direct (and most commonly used) route up Mt. Madison is
the <b>Valley Way</b> from the Appalachia trailhead to <a
href="madison-hut.html">Madison Hut</a>, followed by the <b>Osgood
Trail</b> to the summit [rt: 8.4 miles, 4,100 feet, 6:15]. The trail
is in the trees, and thus protected from the wind, almost all the way
to the hut, which is a good objective if the weather does not allow
for a summit attempt. The <b>Brookside Trail</b> is a much less used
trail that runs a bit closer to Snyder Brook and is an excellent
alternative (same distance). There are two stream crossings, the lower
one (where there used to be a bridge) has good stepping stones, the
upper one may be tricky at high water.  In good weather one can start
up the Valley Way, then take the <b>Watson Path</b> to the summit,
descend to the hut and take the Valley way back (0.1 mile shorter,
same elevation gain).</p>

<p>The Valley Way, while steep, is less steep and smoother than
most of the other trails in the Northern Presidentials. The Watson
Path is steeper and rougher, and also more exposed to the
weather. In compensation, it reaches treeline about 500 feet lower
than the Valley Way, and so has more views.</p>

<p>Another loop that is often done is to go up to Madison Hut by
the <b>Airline Trail</b> and <b>Airline Cutoff</b> trails, then use
the Osgood trail to go to the summit of Mt. Madison and back, and
return by the Valley Way [rt:8.3, 4,100 feet, 6:10]. The Airline
has much better views than the Valley Way, but it is more exposed
and somewhat steeper.</p>

<p>The <b>Howker Ridge Trail</b> [rt: 9.0 miles, 4,450 feet, 6:40]
starts at Randolph East, at the north end of the Dolly Copp Road.
The trail goes through woods with several interesting waterfalls,
then ascends the crest of Howker Ridge, which has four little bumps
called Howks, three of which have good views. It joins the Osgood
Ridge trail shortly before the summit of Mt. Madison. A loop can be
made going up the Howker Ridge trail, and descending by the Osgood
Trail to the hut, then taking the Valley Way and Randolph Path back
to the car [lp: 9.4 miles, 4,450 feet, 6:50].</p>

<p>The <b>Daniel Webster Scout Trail</b> [rt: 8.2 miles, 4,100
feet, 6:10] starts at the Dolly Copp campground road, about 0.9
miles south of the campground entrance. The upper part of the
trail, below its junction with the Osgood Trail is very steep.</p>

<p>The <b>Osgood Trail</b> from the <b>Osgood Cutoff</b> to Madison
Hut is part of the AT and so is often used. Day hikers reach it by
the <b>Great Gulf Trail</b> [rt: 10.2 miles, 4,100 feet, 7:10]. It
has a long section above treeline, this gives great views on days
with good weather, but substantial exposure when the weather is
less good. There is a very rough (rocks and roots) and steep
section before treeline. It can be used as the final segment of a
hike from Pinkham Notch to Madison Hut, using the <b>Old Jackson
Road</b>, <b>Madison Gulf</b> and (for a short distance) <b>Great
Gulf</b> Trails. That is the route of the AT.</p>

<p>The <b>Madison Gulf Trail</b> is one of the many trails that go
up over the headwalls of the many glacial cirques that surround the
Presidentials. Like all of them it is steep and rocky, and requires
occasional scrambles. In exchange you get great views while on the
trail, in addition to the views you get at the summit. Take the
<b>Great Gulf Trail</b> to its junction with the Madison Gulf
Trail, then follow Madison Gulf trail to its end on the Parapet
Trail. Follow the <b>Parapet Trail</b>, then <b>Star Lake
Trail</b>, to the Madison Hut, and take the Osgood Trail to the
summit of Mt. Madison. You can return the same way [rt: 12.8 miles;
4,150 feet; 8:30] or descend by the Osgood Trail [lp: 11.5 miles;
4,150 feet; 7:50].</p>

<h2><a name="winter"></a>Mt. Madison in Winter</h2>

<p>While there are a large number of routes that can be used to climb
Mount Madison in summer, almost all winter hikers use the Valley Way
when they are not also doing Mount Adams.  The trail to the hut (which
is closed in winter) is in the trees, protected from the wind.  It has
moderate grades most of the way, though the final half mile is
steeper.  The climb up to the summit is over a mix of bare rocks, snow
and ice, and is about half a mile.  It is exposed most of the way,
though protected in parts from the prevailing winds.  It is probably
the easiest of the major Presidential peaks, but that does not make it
an easy hike!</p>

<p>Since the climb up Mount Madison only involves about 8&frac12;
miles and 4,000 feet it is probably easier to do it as a dayhike than
as a backpack.  For those who enjoy winter backpacking, and are
willing to carry the extra weight, the Valley Way Campsite is an
attractive option.</p>
