<p>Although I am a member of the AMC 4000 Footer Committee this page,
mainly written before I joined the Committee, is simply <i>my</i>
interpretation of what I had read in various places. The first
question tells you where to go for official answers!</p>

<ul>

the 4000 Footer Club?</a></li>

<li><a href="4000-footer-club.html#lists6">Can I use a mountain bike while bagging a
peak?</a></li>


</ul>

<p><a name="lists0" id="lists0"></a><b>Q</b>. Where can I get
official information about the 4000 Footer Club?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The 4000 Footer Club can be reached at:<br />
<br /> Eric L. Savage, Corresponding Secretary<br />
AMC Four Thousand Footer Committee<br />
P.O. Box 444<br />
Exeter, NH 03833-0444
</p>

<p>You can also email the <a
href="mailto:savage@amc4000footer.org">Corresponding
Secretary</a>.</p>

<p>If you write please enclose a self addressed stamped envelope.
Also note that if you just request the list you will only get the
NH 4000 footer list. Should you want the NE 4000 footer or NE 100
highest lists ask for them explicitly.</p>

<p>The information packet sent to those who request the lists
contains a brief discussion of the rules and an application form,
which consists of a list of the peaks with spaces in which you
record the date climbed and any comments, such as companions.</p>

<p>The Committee has a <a href="http://www.amc4000footer.org">web
site</a>, which includes copies of the <a
href="http://amc4000footer.org/apps.htm">official application
forms</a> in PDF format (so you must print it out and fill the form
manually).</p>

<p>I also keep a copy of the official application form and the
information packet <a href="lists.html">here</a>, together with
spreadsheets in a format acceptable to the Committee.  These can be
filled out on your computer, rather than printed and manually filled
out.</p>

<p><a name="rules1" id="rules1"></a><b>Q</b>. What are the rules
for climbing 4000 footers?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The basic rule is very simple: You must climb (on
foot!) to and from the summit of each peak on the list. In winter
skis and snowshoes are both allowed.</p>

<p>For peaks with trails starting at maintained roads the rule is
simple: Drive to the trailhead then walk (note that you are not
allowed to use the auto roads on Mts Washington, Mansfield and
Equinox). For peaks in areas with rough logging roads you may drive
as far as you dare with a normal car (that includes four wheel
drive), but ATVs are not allowed. See <a href="4000-footer-club.html#lists6">below</a>
for the rules on using mountain bicycles.</p>

<p>You are allowed to count any number of peaks on a single
trip.</p>

<p><a name="rules2" id="rules2"></a><b>Q</b>. How do I apply for
membership?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. When you have finished a list fill out the application
form (either the paper one you received from the Committee or the <a
href="lists.html">Excel spreadsheets</a> supplied on this
site). Precise dates of climbs are not required, as many people decide
to start recording their climbs long after they have started
climbing. A precise date for the last climb is very desirable, please
mark your last climb on the list.  Also the Committee requires an
account of that last climb, or of any other peak, or even an essay on
any topic related to your 4,000 footer experience. In response to my
question the former Corresponding Secretary wrote to me:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have never refused membership for lack of essay, but I still
think people ought to do it as it provides feedback to
us.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Secretary is a volunteer, active in many other areas of the
Club. Please expect the processing of your application to take at
least two months! Since the <a href="4000-footer-club.html#rules3">awards ceremony</a>
is usually held in April it is a good idea for those who have
finished the list over the summer or fall to send their application
in before the end of the year. Those doing the winter peaks will
obviously send their applications in later, but try to send it as
soon as you have finished.</p>

<p>There is an application fee that covers the cost of the scroll,
one patch and postage. The Committee asks that applicants
voluntarily set this fee at $8, but they do not want to deter
anyone from membership because of cost. Therefore the minimum fee
required, which covers the basic expenses is $5. Also additional
patches may be purchased for $3 each. If you pay more than the
required dues the balance goes into a fund that contributes to
trail maintenance, I strongly encourage you to do so.</p>

<p><a name="rules3" id="rules3"></a><b>Q</b>. When is the Awards
Dinner?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Usually in April, those applying for awards are
notified by mail, and it is listed in the <i>AMC Outdoors</i>
magazine. I try to announce the date on the hiking bulletin
boards.</p>

<p>In recent years it has been held
<a href="http://www.amc4000footer.org/dinner.htm">(directions)</a>
at the Cooperative Middle School in Stratham, NH (near Exeter).</p>

<p><a name="lists1" id="lists1"></a><b>Q</b>. Where can I find the
lists?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Right <a href="lists.html">here</a>! Note that the
Committee currently accepts applications printed directly from a
spreadsheet <b>if it is in the required format</b>. I have included
spreadsheets that are acceptable to the Committee. In fact I used
them for all my applications.</p>

<p>As noted above the official web site currently only has the list
in PDF format; it is not suitable for use as a spreadsheet.</p>

<p><a name="lists2" id="lists2"></a><b>Q</b>. What are the recent
changes to the lists?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The lists are periodically revised to reflect the
information on the most current maps. As of April 2001 a few
changes have been made to the lists:</p>

<ul>

<li>For the NH Fours the "D" peak of Wildcat replaces the "E"
peak.</li>

<li>For the NE Fours two peaks in Maine have been elevated to Four
Thousand Footer status, they are Redington and Spaulding.</li>

<li>For the NE Hundred Highest list three peaks have been removed,
and replaced by three new peaks. The peaks removed are Middle
Abraham, Mahoosuc Arm and the North Peak of the Bigelow Horns, all
in Maine. They have been replaced by The Bulge (NH), Cupsuptic Snow
and the North Peak of Kennebago Divide, both in Maine. Note that
there are now two peaks in Maine named "Snow" on the Hundred
Highest list.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="lists3" id="lists3"></a><b>Q</b>. Do all the 4,000
Footers have trails to them?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. All of the Fours have trails to them. In two cases the
trails are not officially maintained. The first is Owl's Head,
where the path is unofficial but well described in the <i>White
Mountain Guide</i> and shown on all maps. The second is
<a href="reddington.html">Mount Redington</a>, and that path, while
clear, is not described in the current Maine Mountain Guide, nor
shown on current maps.</p>

<p><a name="lists4" id="lists4"></a><b>Q</b>. Where can I find
information on the trail-less peaks on the Hundred Highest
list?</p>

<p><b>A</b>.A photocopied pamphlet describing routes to the
trailless peaks on the New England Hundred Highest list is
available from the Four Thousand Footer Committee for $3. A set of
black-and-white USGS maps covering these peaks (printed out from
Maptech CDs) is an additional $2. You can request them from:<br />
<br />
Four Thousand Footer Committee,<br />
Attn: NE 100 Information<br />
P.O. Box 444<br />
Exeter, NH 03833-0444
</p>

<p><a name="lists6" id="lists6"></a><b>Q</b>. Can I use a mountain
bike while bagging a peak?</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Until recently the policy was not to allow them, but
it has recently changed. In the document <i>Routes to New England
Hundred Highest Peaks</i> dated 1/1/02 the following paragraph
appears:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>MOUNTAIN BIKING: The increased popularity of mountain bikes
apparently makes it necessary to come up with some sort of policy.
Please remember that this is a club for hikers; not that we object
to trail bikes <i>per se</i>, but we want to preserve the tradition
of climbing on foot, not on bikes. In winter we have absolutely
forbidden the use of snowmobiles, even when a road is passable to
ordinary cars in summer. However, a similar policy on trail bikes
seems a bit excessive. Therefore I suggest that we all attempt to
live by the following standard: it is acceptable to use bikes on
logging roads that are not part of officially maintained trails
<b>if</b> the road would be fairly easily passable to an average
four-wheel-drive vehicle (<b>not</b> an ATV) without "heroic
measures" such as winches. If you think a jeep might not make it,
then please walk. If everyone can be reasonable about
self-enforcing this standard then I won't be forced to come up with
more excruciating technicalities.</p>
