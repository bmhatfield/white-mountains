<h1>Moderate Hikes on New Hampshire 4000 Footers</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">


<p>Many hikers have done the well known
<a href="franconia.html#LincLaf">Franconia Ridge</a> loop, going up
the Falling Waters trail to Little Haystack, across the ridge over
Lincoln to Lafayette, and down by the Greenleaf and Old Bridle Path
trails. It is a moderately demanding hike of about 9 miles and
3,900 feet of elevation gain, with great views along the ridge
(when the weather cooperates!) as the reward. Here are six less
well known intermediate trips in the White Mountains with great
rewards. All are around ten miles with about 3,000 feet of
elevation gain, and none has any really sustained very steep
section. Please note that ten miles and 3,000 feet of elevation
gain make these solid intermediate climbs!</p>

<p><a href="liberty.html#Flume"><b>Mt. Flume</b></a> by the
Wilderness and Osseo trails (11.2 miles, 3,150 feet). This trail is
much less steep (hence longer) than the better known approaches
from Franconia Notch, with the first few miles through beautiful
open hardwoods. From the summit you get great views into the Pemi,
to the Kinsmans and Moosilauke, and to the south.</p>

<p><a href="garfield.html#Garfield"><b>Mt. Garfield</b></a> by the
Mt. Garfield trail (10.0 miles, 3,000 feet). Another trail with
moderate grades and good footing until the final steep and rough
0.2 miles. You get excellent views into the Pemi Wilderness from
its northern rim, as well as views of the Presidentials beyond.</p>

<p><a href="otherpemi.html#Carrigain"><b>Mt. Carrigain</b></a> by
the Signal Ridge trail (10 miles, 3,250 feet). While Mts. Flume and
Garfield are on the rim of the Pemi, Mt. Carrigain is in its heart.
Thanks to the Sawyer River road it is possible to drive into the
forest for two miles, making this a reasonable trip. There are good
views from the Signal Ridge, then the trail enters the trees again,
to emerge at the summit. There are partial views from the summit,
but fortunately the fire tower is still there, and it affords
unobstructed views in all directions. The Presidentials are much
closer than they were on the two previous summits.</p>

<p><a href="spresi.html#IkePierce"><b>Mts. Eisenhower and
Pierce</b></a> by Edmands and Crawford Paths (8.1 miles, 3,100
feet). Both have easy grades and good footing, this is the easiest
way to enjoy the Presidentials above treeline. Two cars are needed
to do it as a loop, with only one car you should do a round trip up
Crawford's Path to Mt. Eisenhower and back (9.6 miles, 3,350
feet).</p>

<p><a href="carters.html#Dome"><b>Carter Dome and Mt. Hight</b></a>
by the Nineteen Mile Brook, Carter Dome and Carter-Moriah trails
(10.2 miles, 3,500 feet). Most of this trip is on easy grades, but
there is a steep and rough section (0.6 miles, 800 feet) between
Zeta Pass and Mt. Hight. As a reward you get the best views to be
found on the Carter-Moriah trail, with a close view of the
Presidentials to the west, and the lower mountains on both sides on
Evans Notch to the East.</p>

<p><a href="carters.html#Moriah"><b>Mt. Moriah</b></a> by the
Carter-Moriah trail (9.0 miles, 3,400 feet). This is again a gentle
trail, with great views of the northern Presidential giants,
Madison and Adams, just across Rt. 16. In late summer there are
incredible blueberry patches on the ledges.</p>
