<h2>The Trip (continued)</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Day 4: No Hiking</h3>

<p>Friday dawned warmer (in the low teens) but windier, with little
visibility. We scrapped our plans for Baxter Peak and instead
enjoyed exploring the area around the pond and at the base of the
ice falls draped down the side of the mountain. Most of the
lean-tos were in snow to their roof lines, though the snow depth
right next to the structure was nil. If one got down to the
lean-to, one was effectively in a snow cave out of the wind. But I
still preferred the bunkhouse &hellip;</p>

<p>Some of the group skied the North Basin and Blueberry Knoll,
having brought their skis all the way. Snow conditions were quite
good, but the wind never let up. We played a lot of canasta and
cribbage and drank a lot of soup and hot chocolate. On Friday
night, over our spaghetti dinner, we decided to get up very early
the next day and head down to Roaring Brook in the dark. The
weather forecast was for warmer and wet weather and we were hoping
we could get back to the trucks before it started to rain. We had
to do the entire 15-16 miles in one day and most people would ski
out from Roaring Brook. I had decided that I wanted to walk out,
that I would find skiing just too difficult. I am not a strong
skier and find that I fall a lot and get exhausted trying to get
up. I could only imagine that managing a sled while on skis would
simply drive me crazy.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Day 5: Back to
Civilization!</h3>

<p>At 4 am on Saturday, everyone was up and packing. By 5:30 we
were on our way in mild temperatures, but no precipitation.
Headlamps flashed like giant winter fireflies ahead of and behind
me and they were all that one could see in the starless, moonless
darkness. We waited to regroup at the winter route across the
frozen Basin Pond, not wanting to allow anyone to attempt the
crossing alone. By the time we were across Basin Pond, the sky had
lightened considerably and headlamps were stashed away.</p>

<p>I arrived at Roaring Brook about 6:45, loaded my skis and the
leftover beans (now frozen solid and untouched by
critters&mdash;though the plastic bag had been shredded) onto my
sled. I used the outhouse and started on my way shortly after 7 am.
Steve, on skis, overtook me shortly and said he would come back to
get me after he dropped his gear at the truck. That meant it would
be many hours before I saw him or any of the faster skiers, who had
left Roaring Brook well before me. I was well past Avalanche Field
before the remaining four skiers passed me. From that point on, I
was completely alone. This time I recognized
landmarks&mdash;Avalanche Field, Windey pass (about halfway between
Roaring Brook and Togue Pond), Rum Brook picnic area (a bit over a
mile from Togue Pond.). The trip did not seem so endless now. It
became more pleasant when I stopped looking down at the
snow-covered road and looked instead at the beauty around
me&mdash;the woods, the birds, the ponds, the clouds (some very
dark and threatening!). I saw a couple of snowmobilers when I
neared Togue Pond. I reached Togue Pond gatehouse at 10:30, only a
half hour behind the last skiers, I was later to learn. Not bad. I
used the outhouse, took a drink and had some food. Then off I went,
figuring it would be at least an hour until I had to watch for the
turn-off to Abol Bridge. Steve had expected to be back to meet me
before then. Which he was, but just.</p>

<p>I was feeling okay, not depleted as I had been on the trip in
and suggested he head back and be sure the others did not wait for
me, that we would meet them for lunch. Steve said I should not have
any trouble following the trail from that point on. I did make one
wrong turn, however, and ended up exploring the Abol Beach picnic
area which I soon realized was not on my route. I only lost a few
minutes on this detour.</p>

<p>I reached the end of the line and a warm truck at 12:45 pm,
changed my clothes quickly and we met the others for a big hot
lunch and cold beer. I learned I had been less than an hour behind
the last skier over the 16 mile trip and had no blisters or other
foot problems to speak of. Some of the skiers were not so fortunate
and I feel I made the right decision to walk. I may want to work on
my skiing skills before I go into Baxter State Park in winter
again, because skiing is quicker if you know what you're doing and
your boots are comfortable. (Did I say "go into the Park
again"?&mdash;don't quote me on this!)</p>

<p>My overall feelings about my adventure are very positive. The
sight of the snow-covered Katahdin as I approached Chimney Pond was
breathtaking, almost moving me to tears. To be in such a remote
place where so few people go in winter is an experience never to be
forgotten. I hope I can do it again and I hope I can climb Baxter
and North Brother to complete my winter "Fours," but am glad to
have done it at least once, glad my body and mind rose to the
demands of the trip, and glad to be able to share the adventure
with friends and relatives who may never get there.</p>
