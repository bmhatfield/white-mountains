<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.16096&lon=-71.64455&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Lafayette</a>. That point forecast unfortunately only claims an
elevation of about 3,500 feet; expect the actual temperatures to be a
bit lower and the wind speeds a bit higher!
The Mount Washington Observatory's <a
href="http://www.mountwashington.org/weather/summit_forecast.php">Higher
Summits Forecast</a> is also useful.</p>

<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Map</h2>


<p>The map below is a fully interactive Google map, you can zoom in or
out and click on any feature.  Specifically clicking on the P symbols
will allow you to get driving directions to the trailheads.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The <a href="greenleaf-hut.html">Greenleaf Hut</a> is located at
treeline at the junction of the Old Bridle Path [ow: 2.9 miles,
2,150 feet, 2:30] and Greenleaf trail [ow: 2.7 miles, 2,250 feet,
2:30]. It allows an easy two day loop over Mt. Lincoln and Mt.
Lafayette, and in conjunction with the other huts allows traverses
of various lengths to be made.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1a" id="tocref1a"></a>Franconia Notch
Recreational Trail (Bike Path)</h2>

<p>The bike path (maintained by the New Hampshire Division of Parks
and Recreation) connects many of the trailheads in Franconia Notch,
and is useful when making loops with only one car. The following
table gives the cumulative distances (in both directions) and
elevations of several locations on the path.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Routes to Peaks</h2>

<h3><a name="Lafayette" id="Lafayette"></a>Mount Lafayette</h3>

<p>This is almost always climbed (when done alone) by the <b>Old
Bridle Path</b> to the Greenleaf Hut and the <b>Greenleaf Trail</b>
to the summit of Mt. Lafayette (rt: 8.0 miles, 3,600 feet, 5:50).
There are excellent views along the Old Bridle Path, and the last
mile up the Greenleaf trail is entirely above treeline. This is a
deservedly popular trail, do not expect solitude on a nice summer
weekend! It is often combined with Mt. Lincoln (see discussion of
loops below).</p>

<p>There are two other ways of doing Mt. Lafayette alone. It may be
done entirely by the <b>Greenleaf Trail</b> (Rt: 7.6 miles, 3,300
feet, 5:25). This does not have the great views that the Old Bridle
Path has, but it does pass through the wild Eagle Pass. Another
possibility is by the <b>Skookumchuck</b> and <b>Garfield Ridge</b>
trails (rt: 10.2 miles, 3,550 feet, 6:50), the latter going up the
north ridge of Mt. Lafayette above treeline. Both of these are much
less crowded than the popular Old Bridle Path.  They can be combined,
going up the Skookumchuck and Garfield Ridge trails and down Greenleaf
Trail (lp: 8.9 miles, 3,550 feet, 6:15), with 250 fewer feet if done
in the opposite direction.  With only one car this will require a 2.8
mile walk along the Franconia Notch Recreational Trail.</p>

<h3><a name="Lincoln" id="Lincoln"></a>Mount Lincoln</h3>

<p>Normally done by taking the <b>Falling Waters Trail</b> to
Little Haystack, then following the <b>Franconia Ridge Trail</b>
(rt: 7.8 miles, 3,400 feet, 5:35) along the ridge, with great
views, to the summit of Mt. Lincoln. It is often combined with Mt.
Lafayette (see discussion of loops below). The Falling Waters Trail
has a very steep section, and the Franconia Ridge Trail is very
exposed to the weather.</p>

<h3><a name="LincLaf" id="LincLaf"></a>Both (Franconia Ridge
Loop)</h3>

<p>This is a classic, the views along the ridge are spectacular if
the weather cooperates. It is done in either direction, using the
Old Bridle Path, Greenleaf, Franconia Ridge and Falling Waters
trails (lp: 8.9 miles, 3,900 feet, 6:25). About 2 miles of this is
above treeline, you get great views but are exposed to the
weather.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to the Mount Lafayette and
Mount Lincoln:</p>

<h2><a name="winter"></a>Winter Routes</h2>

<p>On a clear day the views from either peak, and from the ridge between
them, is spectacular, so this is an extremely popular winter hike.
Both the Falling Waters Trail and the Old Bridle Path are broken out
soon after a storm.  This is, however, a very dangerous place in bad
weather, and almost every winter at least one party gets lost
descending from the ridge in a whiteout.  These are not mountains to
climb in bad (or even, in my opinion, merely dubious) weather!</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:  Greenleaf Hut is closed in winter.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3"></a>Mt. Lafayette in Winter</h3>

<p>The Skookumchuck Trail is very rarely used in winter, and is very
unlikely to be broken out.  Hence almost everyone climbs Mount
Lafayette by the Old Bridle Path.  The trail is moderate most of the
way, with a couple of steep pitches ("The Agonies", as the croo call
them) that can be difficult to negotiate without crampons.  The climb
above treeline (about &frac12; miles) has at least one spot which can
be moderately difficult to negotiate when it is icy.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4"></a>Mt. Lincoln in Winter</h3>

<p>The Falling Waters Trail is rather difficult in winter, as the
sections near the falls are often icy, and early in the season, before
the streams are frozen and covered with snow, the crossings may be
"interesting".  In addition the final climb to the ridge is steep.
The trail along the ridge (about &frac34; miles each way) is easy as
long as the weather is good.  </p>

<h3><a name="tocref5"></a>Franconia Ridge in Winter</h3>

<p>A spectacular trip that involves around 2&frac12; miles of hiking
above treeline.  While people do it in both directions I prefer to go
up the Falling Waters Trail, as I find it easier to negotiate the
sections along the falls going uphill.  As noted above, it is
<i>not</i> a hike to do in bad weather!</p>
