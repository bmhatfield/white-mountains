<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.18693&lon=-71.61099&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Garfield</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4896880&amp;e=292862&amp;s=100&amp;size=l&amp;u=0&amp;layer=DRG25">
Topozone map</a> of this area of the White Mountains of New
Hampshire.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC operates one <a href="amc-huts.html">hut</a> and two
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsites</a> in this area. Fees are charged at all of them,
reservations are advised at the huts, but there are no reservations
at the campsites.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="galehead-hut.html">Galehead Hut</a> is located at
the junction of the Garfield Ridge and Twinway trails. It is
usually reached by the Gale River and Garfield Ridge trails [ow:
4.6 miles, 2,200 feet, 3:25]. It makes it relatively easy to
combine Mt. Galehead with either Mt. Garfield to the West, or the
Twins to the East. In addition it can be combined with other huts
for a multi-day traverse.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>The Garfield Ridge campsite is located on the Garfield Ridge
trail East of the termination of the Garfield trail [ow: 5.2 miles,
2,700 feet, 4:00]. It has a shelter plus 4 single and 3 double
platforms. It can be used to combine Mt. Garfield with either Mt.
Lafayette to the west, or Galehead Mtn. to the east. It can also be
used for multi-day traverses.</li>

<li>The 13 Falls campsite is on the Franconia Brook trail [ow: 8.1
miles, 1,050 feet, 4:35]. It has 9 hardened tent pads but no
shelter. It can be used for an approach to either Mt. Garfield or
Galehead Mtn. (or both) from the South.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition the Forest Service has two Designated Roadside
Camping Areas along the Gale River and Haystack roads:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Gale River Road</b> - Consists of ten widely scattered sites
along the road. Each includes off road parking, and camper or tent
space. There are no formally developed sites, no potable water
sources, and no fire rings or rest room facilities. There are no
camping charges but the fee pilot program applies.<br />
<br /></li>

<li><b>Haystack Road</b> - There are 11 widely scattered sites
along the road. Each includes off road parking, and camper or tent
space. There are no formally developed sites, no potable water
sources, and no fire rings or rest room facilities. There are no
camping charges but the fee pilot program applies.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>One Day Routes</h2>

<h3><a name="Garfield" id="Garfield"></a>Mount Garfield</h3>

<p>Normally done by the <b>Mt. Garfield Trail</b> (rt: 10.0 miles,
3,000 feet, 6:30), an old tractor road, hence the grades are easy and
the footing is good. The final ascent to the summit of Mt.  Garfield
is by a short, but very steep and rocky, segment of the <b>Garfield
Ridge Trail</b>. While there are no views along the trail, the views
from the summit are excellent.</p>

<p>A more strenuous approach (with two cars) is to go up by the
<b>Skookumchuck</b> and <b>Garfield Ridge</b> trails, and to descend
by the <b>Mt. Garfield Trail</b> (12.0 miles, 4,250 feet,
8:10). Climbing Mount Lafayette from the Skookumchuck junction will
add 1.6 miles and 600 feet, for an additional 1:05 round trip.  The
Garfield Ridge trail is steep and rough, but the upper (west) part of
it has great views.</p>

<p>Those who wish to do the loop with only one car may return to the
Skookumchuck trailhead by taking a <a
href="skook-garf-shortcut.html">shortcut between the Garfield Trail
and the Skookumchuck trailhead</a>. It is long, and there are over 500
feet of ascent (mainly at gentle grades) at the end of a long
trip. There is also a stream crossing that may be challenging at high
water.</p>

<h3><a name="Galehead" id="Galehead"></a>Mount Galehead</h3>

<p>This is done by the <b>Gale River</b>, <b>Garfield Ridge</b> and
<b>Frost</b> trails (rt: 10.2 miles, 2,450 feet, 6:20). There is a
stream crossing that may be difficult at high water, and the final
section of the Gale River trail is very steep and rough.</p>

<h3><a name="TwoGs" id="TwoGs"></a>Mounts Garfield and
Galehead</h3>

<p>These may be combined (lp: 13.7 miles, 3,950 feet, 8:50). This is a
strenuous trip, the Garfield Ridge trail has some very steep and rough
sections here. I prefer to go up Galehead first, so as to go up,
rather than down, this section.  With only one car can either walk on
the road between the two trailheads (about 1.6 additional miles) or
take a <a href="gale-garf-shortcut.html">shortcut</a> using some
logging roads.</p>

<h3><a name="Twins" id="Twins"></a>The Twins</h3>

<p>They are often done together, though North Twin can be done alone
by the <b>North Twin Trail</b> (rt: 8.6 miles, 2,950 feet, 5:45), and
South Twin can be combined with Galehead (below). The usual way is up
the North Twin Trail and then along the <b>North Twin Spur</b> (11.2
miles, 3,700 feet, 7:25).  The North Twin Trail has three stream
crossings that can be difficult, and a very steep section. The first
two stream crossings can be bypassed by bushwhacking along the East
side of the stream, the third crossing is the easiest of the
lot. There are several good viewpoints on North Twin, while South Twin
has great views in all directions.</p>

<h4><a name="GaleTwins" id="GaleTwins"></a>Galehead and Twins (South
or Both)</h4>

<p>Many peakbaggers do North Twin alone on one trip, and to do
Mt. Galehead plus South Twin on a separate one.  This involves a very
steep climb up from Galehead Hut to the summit of South Twin (rt: 11.8
miles, 3,600 feet, 7:40).  It is, of course, possible to add North
Twin to the trip.  With one car that involves going across the North
Twin Spur twice, adding 2.6 miles and 750 feet (1:40) to the trip.
With two cars a loop over all three summits is possible (lp: 12.0
miles, 3,900 feet, 8:00).  Doing the loop in the opposite direction
saves 200 feet of elevation gain (lp: 12.0 miles, 3,700 feet,
7:50).</p>

<h4><a name="TwinsHale" id="TwinsHale"></a>Twins, Zealand and
Hale</h4>

<p>An interesting trip, with spectacular views in good weather, is the
hike over the Twins, down the Twinway to Guyot and to Zealand Hut
(bagging Mount Zealand on the way), then up the Lend a Hand Trail to
Mount Hale.  There are two alternatives for returning from Mount Hale.
The "official" one is by the Hale Brook Trail to Zealand Road,
requiring a second car (lp: 16.7 miles; 5,300 feet; 11:00).  Those who
know how to find the unofficially maintained Firewarden's Trail can
return to their car at the cost of about an extra mile.  This trip
goes over South Twin and Guyot, both with 360&deg; views, and North
Twin and Zeacliff, with excellent (though not 360&deg;) views.</p>

<h4><a name="BondsTwins" id="BondsTwins"></a>The Twins and Bonds</h4>

<p>Several of the multipeak routes to the <a
href="bondrts.html">Bonds</a> go over the Twins.  One of the routes
for doing the <a href="bondrts.html#Bonds1Day">Three Bonds in a
Day</a> is the traverse from the Kanc, over the Bonds and Twins, to
the North Twin trailhead.  The Twins are also frequently included as
part of a <a href="bondrts.html#BondsBackp">Bonds backpack</a> or a <a
href="bondrts.html#BondsHut">Bonds by the Huts</a> trip.  Follow the
links for details, icluding distances and elevation gains.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the routes to the peaks:</p>

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Hut Based Routes</h2>

<p>Galehead Hut can be used as part of a two or three night hut
traverse, in combination with Greenleaf or Zealand Falls huts (or
both). From Greenleaf Hut the trail stays above treeline to the
summit of Lafayette and for an additional mile on the Garfield
Ridge trail, then stays in the trees until the summit of Garfield,
which has excellent views in all directions. In then stays in the
trees essentially to the summit of South Twin. Other excellent
viewpoints are the summit of Guyot and Zeacliff.</p>

<p>The hike between Greenleaf and Galehead Huts is more strenuous
than the numbers (ow: 7.7 miles, 2,950 feet, 5:20) would indicate,
the trail has many ups and downs, and is very rough. For the
reverse direction add 400 feet and roughly 15 minutes. Bagging
Galehead will add 1.0 mile and 250 feet for another 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Going from Galehead to Zealand Huts (ow: 7.0 miles, 1,750 feet,
4:25) you start off with the steep and rough climb to South Twin,
after which the grades are all moderate. Add 1,150 feet and 35
minutes for the reverse direction. Adding North Twin to the trip
adds 2.6 miles and 750 feet (1:40) to the trip. You may also add
<a href="bondrts.html#BondsHut">the Bonds</a> to the trip.</p>

<H2><A NAME="tocref4"></A>Backpack Routes from 13 Falls</H2>

<P> Backpackers are free to string together a large variety of routes.
Here I will just suggest some less well known possibilities that
involve staying at 13 Falls campsite and approaching the ridge from
the south.  As <A HREF="#tocref1">noted above</A> the hike in to the
campsite is about 8 miles with 1,000 feet of elevation gain, for a
booktime of 4:30.
-->

<h2><a name="Winter"></a>Winter Routes</h2>

<p>The trailheads of the Mt. Garfield, Gale River and North Twin
trails are all on Forest Service roads that are gated in winter.  They
can be walked; for the Mt. Garfield Trail this is the only option, and
there is a parking lot just before the gate off Rt. 3.  This adds 1.2
miles each way and around 300 feet of elevation gain.</p>

<p>For the Gale River Trail it is possible to park at the junction of
Trudeau Road and Rt. 3, adding about 1.5 miles each way and about 250
feet of elevation gain.  There is, however, a way that is shorter and
has better parking.  About a mile to the east of the east end of the
Gale River Loop is the Beaver Brook Rest Area, from which a set of XC
ski trails run south of Rt. 3.  You can see a <a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=0&msa=0&msid=103828115753497871383.000443fe9d00a1b2caadc&t=h&z=14">Google
