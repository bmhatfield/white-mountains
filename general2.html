<h2><a name="Web" id="Web"></a> Web Resources</h2>


<h3><a name="WMNF" id="WMNF"></a> White Mountain National Forest
information</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/">WMNF
home page</a> is a good place to look for official information on
rules, campsites etc. There is important information on <a
href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/conditions/roads_status.php">forest
road status</a>, the <a
href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/passes/">parking fee
program</a> and the <a
href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/recreation/camping/2010_backcountry_rules_web.pdf">
Forest Service camping rules.</a></p>

<p>An unofficial, but very informative, site is the former White
Mountain Info Server maintained by Dave Metsky and now renamed <a
href="http://hikethewhites.com/">Hike the Whites!</a>. Lots of
pictures, and even some movies!</p>


<p><a href="general2.html#Top">Return to top</a> <a name="Maps"
id="Maps"></a></p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>A good source of online topographic maps of the entire USA is
<a href="http://www.topozone.com">Topozone.com</a>, which has an
easy to use search mechanism and allows you to see maps in various
scales.</p>

<p>A good locator for places is the
<a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic">USGS Geographic
Names Information System (GNIS)</a>. It will give you the name of
the USGS quad that covers that feature, and will lead you to an
online map on the
<a href="http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/">Microsoft Encarta
TerraServer</a>. The latter can, of course, be used directly
without passing through the GNIS site.</p>

<p>Another map server, that I have not used much, is
<a href="http://www.maptech.com/">Maptech.</a></p>

<p><a href="general2.html#Top">Return to top</a> <a name="Clubs"

<h3>Outdoors Clubs</h3>

<p>The main hiking club of New England is the
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org">Appalachian Mountain Club</a>
(AMC). Most of the hiking activity is run through its local
chapters, the most active ones in the peakbagging areas are the
<a href="http://www.amcboston.org">Boston</a>,
<a href="http://www.amc-nh.org">New Hampshire</a> and
<a href="http://home.gwi.net/amcmaine/">Maine</a> Chapters. The
Boston Chapter (the largest in the Club) is organized by Activity
Committees, the group of most interest to peakbaggers is the
<a href="http://hbbostonamc.org">Hiking and Backpacking
(H/B) Committee</a>. In addition to running trips year round most
Chapters have a variety of workshops.</p>

<p>In the White Mountains of N.H. and Mahoosuc Mountains of Maine,
the AMC maintains 14 popular
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsites</a>, some with shelters.</p>

<p>The AMC also operates eight <a href="amc-huts.html">huts</a> in
the WMNF. Check
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/lodging-shuttle.cfm">here</a>
for a schematic map of the hut system, together with the schedule
for the shuttle that runs between them.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/">Randolph
Mountain Club</a> is very active in the Randolph area, which
includes the Northern Presidentials. They maintain four shelters on
the northern slopes of the Presidentials: Gray Knob, Log Cabin, The
Perch and Crag Camp. Dave Metsky has
<a href="http://hikethewhites.com/shelters.html">descriptions
and photos of them</a>, plus a
<a href="http://hikethewhites.com/photos/map_rmc.jpg">map</a>
showing their locations.</p>

<p>The corresponding club in Vermont is the
<a href="http://www.greenmountainclub.org">Green Mountain Club</a>,
which maintains the Long Trail. If your interests start moving
towards the Adirondacks you may be interested in the
<a href="http://www.adk.org">Adirondack Mountain Club</a> and in
the unrelated <a href="http://www.adk46r.org">Adirondack
Forty-Sixers</a>.</p>

<h3>Online Communities</h3>

<p>There are many outdoors oriented online forums, but I use only
two families:</p>

<ul>

<li>The AMC operates <a
href="http://appalachia.outdoors.org/bbs/">several discussion
groups</a> on its web site. The ones I find most useful are:

<ul>

<li>Hiker's Journal, for discussions of hiking in the Northeast,
mainly in New England. A good place for queries about trail
conditions, choice of trails and similar topics.</li>

<li>The Trail Conditions board is meant for more specific
discussion of trail conditions, there is much overlap with the
Hiker's Journal.</li>

<li>Gear Talk, which is where you ask about gear.</li>

<li>Mountains and Molehills, for discussions of current "hot
issues".  The discussions often get heated, and I have long ago
stopped reading this forum.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.vftt.org/forums/index.php">Views from the
Top</a> (VFTT) site, which has two very useful boards: 

<ul>

<li>Northeast Q &amp; A Forum covers the entire Northeast, so it is
the better place for queries and discussions of the
Adirondacks.</li>

<li>Current Northeast Trail Conditions where hikers report on trail
conditions, it is divided by state, and the New Hampshire section
has the most posts.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<p>There is a lot of overlap of contributors and topics between
these two boards, most regulars use both. If you have any questions
about anything on this site, you will get an answer at one or the
other of those boards. Since most regulars visit both it is
considered bad form to post the same query to both (unfortunately many
people do so).</p>

<p>There are two other bulletin boards that contain much useful
information, though I visit them much less frequently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://alpinezone.com">AlpineZone.com</a> has a <a
href="http://forums.alpinezone.com/">bulletin board</a> with several
different forums related to skiing and hiking.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.backpacker.com">Backpacker.com</a> has many
hiking related forums, the only one I visit (occasionally) is the <a
href="http://www.backpacker.com/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.cgi?act=SF;f=812107219">Destinations:
Northeast</a> forum.</li>

</ul>

<p>In early 2009 a new French language forum for hiking in the
Northeast (Quebec, Adirondacks, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine) was
started: <a
href="http://www.fousderando.com/">FousDeRando.com</a>.  Many of
the posters are regulars on the English language forums, so I hope and
expect it to be an additional valuable resource.</p>


<p>All forums have regular
contributors who will be happy to answer questions.</p>

<p><a href="general2.html#Top">Return to top</a> <a name="Safety"
id="Safety"></a></p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>This site assumes that you know how to hike safely and are seeking
information on getting to specific peaks. The <i>White Mountain
Guide</i> has good introductory material on clothing, equipment, trail
following, and the special concerns on the higher summits. The New
Hampshire Fish and Game Department (who are responsible for search and
rescue missions) has some <a
href="http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/Outdoor_Recreation/hiking_safety.htm">
Tips for Safe Hiking in New Hampshire</a>, which include a list of
recommended clothing and equipment.  More recetly they have developed,
in association with the White Mountain National Forest, an entire web
site devoted to <a href="http://www.hikesafe.com/">safe
hiking</a>.</p>

<p>An excellent book dealing with safety in the mountains is Dan
Allen's aptly titled book <i>Don't Die on the Mountain</i>.</p>

<p>The <a href="general2.html#Clubs">AMC and its chapters</a> give a large
variety of courses on basic hiking, backpacking, and specific
skills such as navigation with map and compass and wilderness first
aid. While intended for members they are also open to non
members.</p>
