<p>The ideal way to get started with winter hiking is to learn by
hiking with experienced friends who are good teachers.  For those who
do not have such friends, some suggestions follow.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1"></a>Courses</h2>

<p>An alternative to knowledgeable friends is taking one of the many
courses offered by outdoors clubs.  A major advantage of such courses
is that you get to meet many potential hiking companions among your
fellow participants, and also get to know many trip leaders.</p>

<p>Note that some courses are offered by volunteers, and hence are
usually low cost.  Others are offered by the paid staff of the clubs,
and are unavoidably more expensive.  I list a few that I am familiar
with, there are obviously many others:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Boston Chapter of the AMC runs an annual <a
href="images/WHP2006.pdf">Winter Hiking
and Backpacking Course</a>, with five evenings of lectures in Boston
and a series of optional trips.  I have been associated with it for
several years and so may be biased, but I think it is an outstanding
course at a very low cost.</li>

<li>The New Hampshire Chapter of the AMC offers two courses.  The
older one is the <a
href="http://www.amc-nh.org/workshop-winter.html">Annual Winter
Workshop</a>, offered twice each winter.  It consists of a weekend
spent at Cardigan Lodge, with lectures each day (including Friday
evening) and hikes on Saturday and Sunday.  The newer one is the <a
href="http://www.hewhohikes.com/amc/">Winter Hiking Series</a>,
which consists of a day of lectures and several graded hikes.  Both
are offered by volunteers, and hence are reasonably priced.</li>


<li>The paid staff of the AMC offers several courses every winter, the
exact selection varies from year to year.  Check their <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/education/workshops/availability/index.cfm/fuseaction/search.all/">Outdoors
Adventures and Workshops</a> page to see what is available.</li>


<li>The <a href="http://www.winterschool.org/">Winter Mountaineering
School</a> has been sponsored for 50 years by the Adirondack Mountain
Club.  I find this course rather expensive, since it is taught by
volunteers yet charges almost as much as many courses given by the AMC
staff.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref2"></a>Books</h2>

<p>Books are a very poor substitute for personal instruction, but I
list some books that may be helpful.  The first two books are quite
useful for day hikers, in spite of their titles.  They both contain
good discussions of winter hiking gear and of how to travel on snow or
ice, and both include a discussion of back country skiing.</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Winterwise &ndash; A Backpacker's Guide</i> by John M. Dunn,
Adirondack Mountain Club, 1996.</li>

<li><i>AMC Guide to Winter Camping</i> by Stephen Gorman,
2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, Appalachian Mountain Club, 1999.</li>

<li><i>Snowshoe Hikes in the White Mountains</i> by Steven D. Smith,
Bondcliff Books, 2000.  This book gives some useful advice for
beginning winter hikers, and describes a large number of easier hikes,
including hikes to some of the easier 4,000 footers.</li>

</ul>

<p>And finally, two books that even experienced winter peakbaggers
will find invaluable:</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Don't Die on the Mountain</i> by Dan Allen, 2<sup>nd</sup>
Edition, Diapensia Press, 1998.  An outstanding guide to safe hiking,
with substantial emphasis on winter hiking in the northeast.</li>

<li><i>The 4,000-Footers of the White Mountains &ndash; A Guide and
History</i> by Steven D. Smith and Mike Dickerman, Bondcliff Books,
2001.  The only hiking guide that includes suggested routes to the
4,000 footers in winter.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref3"></a>Web Resources</h2>

<p>The main AMC web site has a good section on <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/activities/snow/index.cfm">Snow
Sports</a>, with several pages of advice on gear for winter hiking.
The Hiking and Backpacking Committee of the Boston Chapter of the AMC
has an excellent <a
href="http://world.std.com/~bostonhb/resources.html">Hiking
Resources</a> section, with several pages discussing winter hiking
gear.</p>

<p>An excellent but brief guide to winter hiking in New Hampshire is
<a href="http://hikenh.netfirms.com/WinterNH.htm">Considerations for
Winter Hiking in New Hampshire</a>.</p>

<p>I am starting to add a section on winter routes to each peaks page
in which I state which routes <i>I</i> think are best in winter.
While I have given a lot of thought to my choices I realize that this
is often a judgment call, so please use yours!</p>

<p>The various hiking bulletin boards are an excellent resource.  Most
have forums where trail conditions are posted and others for general
discussions.</p>

<p>The trail conditions forums are very useful for getting an idea
about the conditions of the trails.  Note that conditions can rapidly
change!  A trail that was well broken out last weekend is likely to be
covered with deep snow on Saturday if a heavy snowfall occurred
mid-week!  The discussion forums are most useful for answering
questions about current conditions, and to some extent questions about
the "best" routes to a peak.  Discussions on gear quickly get
emotional, as personal preferences play a very large role in gear
choices.  The ones I am most familiar with are:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.viewsfromthetop.com/">Views From the Top</a>
(VFTT to many of the regulars) is an excellent site, with bulletin
boards and other features.  It covers the entire northeast, and in
recent years seems to be becoming more New York (both Adirondacks and
Catskills) than New England oriented.  There still is considerable
useful information for New Englanders posted there.</li>

<li>The <a
href="http://appalachia.outdoors.org/bbs/index.cfm">Appalachian
Mountain Club (AMC) Bulletin Boards</a>, with a very definite New
England orientation.  They also have a separate gear forum.  There is,
of course, an immense amount of information on the <a
href="http://appalachia.outdoors.org/">main AMC web site</a>.</li>

<li>The <a
href="http://forums.alpinezone.com/index.php?viewcat=2">AlpineZone
bulletin boards</a> are again heavily oriented towards New England,
and in addition are much more ski and snowboard oriented than the
first two.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.adkforum.com/">Adirondack Hiking Forum</a>
is a similar forum oriented mainly, as its name indicates, to the
Adirondacks.</li>

</ul>
