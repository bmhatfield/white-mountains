<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>


<p>There are no established backcountry campsites in this area, but
you may be interested in the

Road.</p>

<h2><a name="Tecumseh"></a>Mount Tecumseh</h2>

<p>The <b>Mt. Tecumseh Trail</b> starts at the Waterville Valley
ski area and goes over the summit of Mt. Tecumseh, then descends to
Tripoli Road about a mile from the start of the Mt. Osceola trail.
Most hikers attempt it from the ski area (rt: 5.0 miles, 2,200
feet, 3:35). This is an easy trip, but not quite as easy as the
numbers suggest, as there is a long steady fairly steep climb.
There are no views on the trail itself, but a short spur leads to
the ski slopes and good views into the valley. There are also
limited views from the summit.</p>

<p>I prefer the approach from the other end of the trail, on
Tripoli Road (rt: 6.2 miles, 2,600 feet, 4:25). There are some
views along this trail, and the woods seem more attractive. The
stream crossing near the start can be difficult at high water. With
two cars it is possible to do a traverse (lp: 5.6 miles, 2,400
feet, 4:00).</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to Mount Tecumseh:</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="Osceola"></a>Mount Osceola</h2>

<p>The <b>Mt. Osceola Trail</b> starts on Tripoli Road, about 2
miles from Livermore Road in Waterville Valley, and ends on the
Greeley Ponds Trail about 1.3 miles south of the Kanc. The main
peak is an easy trip from Tripoli Road (rt: 6.4 miles, 2,050 feet,
4:15), with easy grades almost the whole way. Those who have
already done the main peak may climb the East peak alone by using
the <b>Greeley Ponds Trail</b> from the Kanc,
then ascending the very steep and rough Mt. Osceola Trail to the
East Peak (rt: 5.6 miles, 2,200 feet, 3:55).</p>

<p>The easiest way of doing both peaks is from Tripoli Road, over the
main peak and on to the East peak and back (rt: 8.4 miles, 2,950 feet,
5:40). The section between the col and the East peak is steep and
rough, and there is a chimney (that can be bypassed) going from the
main peak to the col. It is also possible to do both peaks from the
Kanc (rt: 7.6 miles, 3,100 feet, 5:20). This involves going both up
and down the steep rocky section from the Greeley Pond trail to the
East peak. In winter, when Tripoli Road is closed to cars, this is the
standard route.  Around the start and end of winter you should check
the <a
href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mountain/conditions/roads_status.php">status
of forest service roads</a>.</p>

<p>A very popular loop trip is to go up by the Greeley Ponds trail
(from the Waterville Valley end) to the East peak, go over to the main
peak, and descend to Tripoli Road (lp: 9.8 miles, 2,400 feet,
6:30). Add another 2.8 miles going down Tripoli Road if you only have
one car.</p>

times of the various possible routes to Mount Osceola:</p>

<h2><a name="tocref4"></a>Sandwich Mountain</h2>

<p>Sandwich Mountain (often called Sandwich Dome) is not a 4,000
footer, but is a very popular hiking destination in the Waterville
Valley area, and is on the <a href="ne-hundred-highest.html">New
England 100 Highest</a> list.</p>

</div>

<p>The majority of hikers climb the mountain by one (or both) of
two trails that start on the outskirts of Waterville Valley. These
are the <b>Sandwich Mountain Trail</b> (rt: 7.8 miles, 2,600 feet,
5:10) and the <b>Drake's Brook Trail</b> (rt: 8.8 miles, 2,600
feet, 5:40). The two trails start from the same trailhead, and meet
about one mile from the summit of Sandwich Mountain, shortly before
a spur path leads to the scenic subpeak known as Jenning's Peak.
The two trails are often combined to make a loop (lp: 8.3 miles,
2,600 feet, 5:25). The Sandwich Mountain Trail has a rather steep
section going up to Noon Peak, while the grades of the Drake's
Brook Trail are much gentler.</p>

<p>The <b>Smart's Brook Trail</b> starts much lower down on Rt 49,
and hence has quite a bit more elevation gain (rt: 11.4 miles,
3,100 feet, 7:15). Grades are gentle most of the way, though there
is a steeper section over the last 500 feet before it reaches the
ridge, where it joins the Sandwich Mountain Trail midway between
Jenning's Peak and the main summit.</p>

<p>The most scenic trail is the <b>Algonquin Trail</b> (rt: 9.0
miles, 2,550 feet, 5:45), from the Sandwich Notch Road (not plowed
in winter). The trail is steep and rough, and there are a few rocky
scrambles. There are several outstanding views of the Sandwich
Notch area with its many ponds.</p>

<p>The final two trails approach the mountain from the south. The
<b>Bennett Street Trail</b> starts from the Flat Pond Trail 0.3
miles beyond Jose's Bridge (rt: 9.0 miles, 2,900 feet, 6:00), while
the steeper <b>Gleason Trail</b> (rt: 7.6 miles, 2,900 feet, 5:15)
begins and ends on the Bennett Street Trail. The two trails are
often combined making a nice loop (lp: 8.3 miles, 2,900 feet,
5:35).</p>

times of the various possible routes to Sandwich Dome:</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6"></a>Mt. Tecumseh in Winter</h3>

<p>Since Tripoli Road is unplowed in winter the only common route is
from the ski area.  This is a popular trail, and so is likely to be
broken out soon after a storm.  For the final approach to the summit I
usually take the Sossman Trail, which I find quite a bit easier than
the Mount Tecumseh Trail.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7"></a>Mt. Osceola in Winter</h3>

<p>Since Tripoli Road is not plowed in winter the only possible
approach is from the Greeley Pond Trail, and since winter peakbaggers
try to minimize distance it is almost always approached from the Kanc.
This is a mountain that is rarely hiked by non-peakbaggers, so the
trail is less likely to be broken out soon after a storm.  The steep
section going up to the East Peak can be challenging, as can the
slide.  Beyond the East Peak both the chimney and its bypass can also
be "interesting".</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8"></a>Sandwich Dome in Winter</h3>

<p>The two trails from the upper end of Rt. 49 (Sandwich Mountain and
Drake's Brook trails) are fairly often hiked by non-peakbaggers and so
are likely to be well broken out.  There is a long steep section on
the Sandwich Mountain Trail, and while the Drake's Brook Trail is much
easier is does have a short section that is rather steep.</p>
