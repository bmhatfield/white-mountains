<h3>Wandering Through the White Mountains&mdash;A Hiker's
Perspective. By Steven D. Smith.  Bondcliff Books. 2004. 338 pages,
$19.95</h3>

<p>Steve Smith, <i>Appalachia's</i> "News and Notes" editor and the
proprietor of <a href="http://www.mountainwanderer.com/">The Mountain
Wanderer</a>, a bookshop in Lincoln, NH, has spent more than a
quarter-century wandering around the White Mountains, during which
time he has, in his words, "&hellip; bagged peaks, pursued ponds,
red-lined trails, and pushed off into little-visited nooks and
crannies".  In addition to several books he has written a weekly hiking
column for Summer Week, a free local newspaper, as well as other
publications.  This book is a compilation of new and previously
published articles, some of the latter in their original form and
others significantly updated or expanded. In what follows I only
mention a few of the 42 chapters in the book.</p>

<p>The book is divided into seven sections. The first, Tales from the
Trails, consists of several short chapters ("The Walking Stick" and
"The Many Paces of Hiking" are two of them), as well as a longer
discussion of bears in our mountains, which includes an account of the
depredations of Brutus, the notorious bear who terrorized campers in
the Pemigewasset Wilderness in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>The second section, the longest in the book, is A White Mountain
Sampler.  It includes two lengthy chapters on viewpoints, including
many that are off the beaten path, as well as one on "Loops Below
4,000 Feet". The latter is a much-needed antidote to the 4,000 footer
obsession of too many hikers!  It also includes a chapter on
statistics, many of which will probably be unfamiliar to even
experienced hikers.</p>

<p>This is followed by a section on Looking Back, which includes a
chapter on the history of logging in Lincoln Woods, and a "Hiking Hall
of Fame" that appeared in the December 2000 issue of <i>Appalachia</i>.
There is also a long review of <i>Forest and Crag</i>, an outstanding
history of the mountains of the Northeast written by Laura and Guy
Waterman.</p>

<p>The section on Stewardship starts off with a very helpful "Who's
Who in the White Mountains", describing the many organizations behind
the myriad acronyms that appear in the <i>White Mountain Guide</i>.
There are two chapters on the Watermans, whose names are closely
associated with the protection of the alpine flora on Franconia
Ridge.</p>

<p>The section Exploring Farther Afield takes us with the author on
his occasional trips away from the White Mountains, to Baxter State
Park in Maine, along the Long Trail in Vermont, and to both the
Catskills and Adirondacks in New York State.</p>

<p>The author is a member of the AMC Four Thousand Footer
Committee, so it is not surprising that the book contains a good
section on Bagging the Peaks.  Notable is the chronology and
collection of records in "The First and the Fastest", and the "Diary
of a Winter Peakbagger".  The latter describes most of the author's
winter ascents; I highly recommend it to anyone about to embark on
this wonderful insanity.  Two other chapters deal with very long
hikes; one to Owl's Head (which he has visited multiple times, both in
summer and in winter), the other a traverse of the Bonds from Zealand
Road to Lincoln Woods.</p>

<p>The final section is Adventures On and Off the Trails.  For the
romantically inclined there is "It Must Be Love if She Goes
Bushwhacking with You on Valentine's Day", the story of his early
hikes with his wife-to-be.  Those who love the suffering of
bushwhacking through thick growth will relish "Bushwhacking
Carrigain", as well as his explorations in "East of Passaconaway" and
"The Wild in Wild River". Two chapters deal with winter hiking: "A
Moonlight Snowshoe Trek" and "But How do you Go to the Bathroom?".</p>

<p>Smith has tramped extensively on and off the beaten track, and he
shares many of his discoveries with us in this informative and
enjoyable collection.  The variety of topics and Smith's smooth style
will ensures that every reader will find favorites amongst these
essays.  My own favorite was the moonlight trip to Lonesome Lake in
winter; I am planning to do that trip myself as soon as winter
returns!</p>

<p>This is adapted from a review I wrote for the Winter/Spring 2005
issue of <i>Appalachia</i>.  I thank the Editor for permission to use
it here.</p>
