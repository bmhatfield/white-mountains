<p>This section deals with what I call "My Adventures". It contains
a miscellaneous collection of reports of trips that seem to me to
be of some interest, either because of the difficulty of the trip,
its length or simply its distance from New England.</p>

<ul>

<li>In March 2000 I did a
<a href="mt-washington-winter.html">Southern Presidential Half
Traverse</a>, going up Mt. Washington by the standard Lions Head
route, then taking the Crawford Path over Mounts Monroe and
Eisenhower to Crawford Notch, spending one night camped close to
Mount Monroe.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>In the summer of 2001 I attempted a
<a href="my-presi-traverse.html">Presidential Traverse</a>. Nothing
very unusual about it, a few hundred people do it every summer, but
for me it was a big trip, with lots of preparation, training etc.
Closely related to it is the
<a href="presidential-traverse.html">Presidential Traverse
FAQ</a>.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>In January 2002 I was a participant on a
<a href="Bonds.html">Three Bonds in a Day</a> trip which ended up
taking 26 hours (from 6 AM Sat. to 8 AM Sun.). I believe that
definitely qualifies as an adventure!<br />
<br /></li>

<li>In the winter of 2002 I was invited to join a group of friends
on a week long trip to <a href="baxter2002.html">Baxter State
Park</a>. Though I did not feel ready for six nights of winter
camping, I jumped on the opportunity.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>Soon after I posted a report on my Baxter trip I received
<a href="baxter97.html">a very similar one</a> from Sam Jamke, who
had just finished the New England Hundred Highest in Winter in Feb.
2002. What struck me about it was how similar her initial fears
were to mine, and how she discovered, just as I did a few years
later, that Baxter in winter was not as terrible as it
seemed.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>I am starting to write trip reports on my bushwhacks, I will
put them in this section until there are enough of them to make a
separate section. The first one is a bushwhack up
<a href="nubble.html">Peak Above the Nubble</a>, a peak on the
<a href="ne-hundred-highest.html">New England Hundred Highest
List</a>. A couple of days later I climbed up
<a href="mendon.html">Mendon Peak in Vermont</a>. Kevin Rooney
kindly sent me his report on a trip to
<a href="farmaine.html">Boundary Peak, Whitecap, the North Peak of
Kennebago Divide and Cupsuptic Snow</a>, all on the NE 100 Highest
list.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>I am not really a highpointer, but now that I am retired I am
traveling more, and starting to look at those highpoints that seem
interesting. In July 2002 I spent two weeks in Colorado, and hiked
up <a href="elbert.html">Mount Elbert, the Colorado Highpoint</a>.
A week after my return I hiked up <a href="great-gulf.html">Mount
Washington by the Great Gulf</a>. This was not my first climb up
Mount Washington, but was definitely the most interesting non
winter one, so I am including it here. In late August 2002 I went
to California to climb <a href="mount-whitney-2002.html">Mount
Whitney</a>, that is the end of my highpointing adventures for this
year!</li>

<li>In August 2004 I spent a few days in the Adirondacks, visiting <a
href="mount-marcy.html">Mount Marcy</a> as well as two other county
highpoints.  I returned to the Adirondacks the following winter to
hike <a href="mount-marcy-winter-2005.html">Mount Marcy in
winter</a>.</li>

</ul>
