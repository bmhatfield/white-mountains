<h1>Winter Car Camping: A Low Stress Introduction to Sleeping out in the Cold</h1>

<p>For years the Hiking and Backpacking Committee of the Boston
Chapter of the AMC has been organizing a fairly low stress
introductory winter backpack as part of its winter program, and
individual leaders have also been leading easier backpacks to
places like Ethan Pond. This year we wanted to add something easier
to encourage those who found even those trips too "scary".</p>

<p>We decided to try a winter car camp. We would drive up to the
campsite in daylight, and would be dry as we would not have been
hiking. This would avoid two of the potential problems with a real
winter backpack: arriving with damp clothing from the strenuous
trip and setting up camp in the dark. We would also not be carrying
a heavy pack all day. Finally, anyone who "freaked out" in the
middle of the night would have the option of getting into the car
and driving to a motel (or to Boston). I did not expect anyone to
use that option, but its availability might make them more
comfortable.</p>

<p>We chose the WMNF Hancock campground in Lincoln as one close to
Boston, and to my NH home. The five participants met at my home at
2:30, and we spent some time discussing gear and making up
deficiencies. We reached the campground around 3:30, set up tents
in daylight, and started melting snow in spite of the fact that the
pump was working. Melting snow is an integral part of the real
winter camping experience!</p>

<p>By 6 PM we had all had dinner, and we went for a walk around the
campground with headlamps, and by 7 PM we started drifting into our
tents. Next morning we woke up around 6:30 AM, made breakfast,
broke camp, and drove along the Kanc to the logging road that leads
to the Mt Potash trail.</p>

<p>All of the participants enjoyed the trip (overnight lows were in
the high teens) and all said that they learned a lot in a low
stress situation. Think of this as an option when trying to
introduce a friend to the joys of winter camping!</p>

<p>Note: The Hancock and Barnes Field campgrounds are fully open,
with plowed access roads and plowed sites (easy for cars, not much
snow on which to camp). Several other campgrounds are open but
unplowed, they include Big Rock and Blackberry Crossing on the
Kanc, and Waterville on Tripoli Road shortly after it leaves Rt 49.
The unplowed campgrounds are half price in winter. I assume that it
is illegal to camp in the closed campgrounds (all others), but have
no idea how strictly that is enforced.</p>

of the <i>Charles River Mud</i>, the newsletter of the Boston
Chapter of the AMC. I thank the Editor of the Mud and the Chair of
the Boston Chapter for permission to use it here.</p>
