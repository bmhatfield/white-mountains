<p>While Bear Mountain (elevation 2,316 feet) is the highest
<i>summit</i> in Connecticut, the highest <i>point</i> in that
state (elevation 2,380 feet) is on the south slope of Mount
Frissell, along the Mount Frissell trail, a little to the west of
the summit (elevation 2,653 feet). Most highpointers reach it by a
rather short route starting high up in the col between Mt. Frissell
and Bear Mountain, at an elevation of around 1,800 feet. While
planning a trip to the CT highpoint I decided to look for more
interesting ways of reaching that point. This trip eventually
became a four day
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/berkshires.html">highpointing
expedition in the Berkshires</a>.</p>

<p>County highpointers may want to attempt to reach the two nearby
New York county highpoints:
<a href="http://www.cohp.org/ny/new_york_E.html#Dutchess">Dutchess
County</a> (the summit of Brace Mountain) and
<a href="http://www.cohp.org/ny/new_york_E.html#Columbia">Columbia
County</a> (on Massachusetts state line 0.3 mile west of Alander
Mountain). The <a href="mount-frissell.html#tocref16">Resources</a> section has
information on maps of the region; for those who do not have a
paper map I am including a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;n=4658257&amp;e=624996&amp;s=100&amp;size=l&amp;u=0&amp;layer=DRG25">
Topozone map</a> of the area.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Routes to Mount
Frissell</h2>

<p>I have not attempted to list all possible routes to Mount
Frissell, just those that I think a highpointer is most likely to
use. Many other routes can be put together using any of the maps in
the resources section. Since most highpointers do not hike as part
of a large group I have not described any routes which require a
car spot.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>From the East</h3>

<p>A high valley separates the South Taconic Range from the Bear
Mountain-Mount Everett Range to its east. Three trailheads, all at
elevations of over 1,600 feet, lie on a road in that valley. More
ambitious hikers can start east of the Bear Mountain, climbing over
it, descending to the valley, and then ascending Mt. Frissell.</p>

<h4><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>The Standard Route</h4>

<p>I am including this for completeness, it is well described in
all highpointing books. The trail starts on the Massachusetts side
of the border with Connecticut, on a road called East Street in MA
and Mount Washington Road in CT. It first goes over Round Mountain
(open summit, good views), climbing very steeply. After Round
Mountain the trail descends to a col then climbs, very steeply
again, to the summit of Mount Frissell. The summit itself is
wooded, but there are good views on the eastern ledges.</p>

<p>From the summit it is a short distance to the highpoint on the
boundary, passing the south ledges with good views. The tri-state
point (MA, CT and NY) is a bit further along the same trail. The
round trip distance to the highpoint is 2.6 miles, with roughly
1,000 feet of total elevation gain. This gives a
<a href="faq1.html">book time</a> of 1:50.</p>

<p>Note that there are two sections on this short trail that the
<i>Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail Guide</i> (see Books below)
describes as "very steep". A friend has used the word "climbing" to
describe those two sections.</p>

<h4><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Jeep Road from Mount
Washington Road</h4>

<p>This easier approach uses an old jeep road (called the Brace
Mountain Trail in the <i>Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail
Guide</i>) that starts from the Mount Washington Road about 1.2
miles south of the state border. It climbs part way up Brace
Mountain and meets first the southern end of the Ashley Hill Trail
and shortly after the South Taconic Trail. Turn right (north) on
either of these to reach the Mt. Frissell Trail west of the
tri-state point. Follow that trail eastward, passing the tri-state
point and the Connecticut highpoint before ascending to the summit
of Mt. Frissell. Round trip distance is 3.4 miles with an elevation
gain of about 600 feet, for a book time of 2:00.</p>

<p>County highpointers will want to go south for a short distance
on the South Taconic Trail to get to the summit of Brace Mountain,
the highpoint of Dutchess County. Others may want to reach it for
the excellent views.</p>

<p>These two routes can be combined to make a loop, which will
include a road walk of 1.2 miles.</p>

<h4><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Over Bear Mountain</h4>

<p>This route takes you over the highest summit in Connecticut on
the way to the state's highpoint. Take the Undermountain Trail, off
CT 41 north of Salisbury, to its junction with the AT. Go north
(right) on the AT over Bear Mt. and down the steep North side. From
the top you go about &frac34; mile down very steeply and as soon as
the trail flattens out there is an unmarked trail to the left (if
you get to the junction with Paradise Lane and signs to Sages
Ravine you've gone too far). Follow this trail for about 0.8 miles
to the Mt. Washington Road, almost across the road from the start
of the Mt. Frissell Trail. Follow that trail over Round Mountain
and the summit of Mount Frissell to the Connecticut highpoint.
Round trip distance is 9.6 miles with an elevation gain of 3,000
feet, book time is 6:15.</p>

<p>This may be turned into a loop by using the Paradise Lane Trail
to bypass the summit of Bear Mountain in one direction, the
distance is unchanged but there are 500 fewer feet of elevation
gain for a book time of 6:00.</p>

<h4><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Loop over Alander
Mountain</h4>

<p>A scenic loop over Alander Mountain starts at the Mt. Washington
State Forest Headquarters on East Street in the town of Mt.
Washington, Massachusetts. Take the Mount Alander Trail to the
summit of Mount Alander. There are two choices from the summit. You
may go down by the South Taconic Trail, going over the highpoint of
Columbia County, NY, or you may take the Alander Loop Trail which
joins the South Taconic Trail. In either case, follow the South
Taconic Trail to its junction with the Mt. Frissell Trail, and take
that trail eastwards passing the tri-state marker and Connecticut
highpoint on the way to the summit of Mount Frissell.</p>

<p>Return by following the Mt. Frissell Trail back west slightly
beyond the tri-state marker, then take the Ashley Hill Trail north
to join the Alander Mountain Trail a short distance from the
trailhead. Round trip distance is 11.2 miles, with 1,600 feet of
elevation gain, book time is 6:25.</p>

<p>It is obviously possible to add Brace Mountain to this loop.
Before heading east on the Mount Frissell Trail follow the Taconic
Crest Trail south for 0.5 mile to the summit of Brace Mountain,
then return to the Mount Frissell Trail. There is minimal elevation
gain, so add 0:30 to book time.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>From the West</h3>

<h4><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>South Taconic Trail from the
South</h4>

<p>This starts at the Rudd Pond Farms residential development in
New York State. The South Taconic Trail starts gently going
eastwards along the side of a field. It soon starts to climb
steeply, over very rough terrain, and there are some scrambles up
ledges that I found unpleasantly exposed (your tolerance for
exposure may well be greater than mine!). Reaching the ridge it
goes north over Brace Mountain (highpoint of Dutchess County, NY),
to its junction with the Mt. Frissell Trail. That trail passes by
the tri-state point, then the highpoint of CT, and then climbs to
the summit on an open slope with great views. The round trip
distance to the summit of Mount Frissell is 6.6 miles with about
1,500 feet of elevation gain, book time is 4:00. This is the route
that I used to do
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nhfours/frissell-brace.html">Mount
Frissell and Brace Mountain</a> in the spring of 2003.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9a" id="tocref9a"></a>Mount Frissell in
Winter</h3>

<p>Many highpointers think of Mount Frissell as an easy highpoint,
largely because of the short (but steep!) standard route. Many are
unpleasantly surprised when they attempt it in winter. The
Connecticut access to the standard route is closed in winter, and
the route itself can be tricky, with the steep rocky climbs covered
with snow. Before attempting the trip, read the trip reports by
<a href="http://www.network54.com/Forum/message?forumid=198362&amp;messageid=1075036647">

<h2><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>Directions to
Trailheads</h2>

<p>The Undermountain Trail starts on a state road well shown on all
maps, all the others start on more obscure roads.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Trailheads on Mt.
Washington Road</h3>

<p>The Alander Mountain Trail, the Mount Frissell Trail and the
Jeep Road all start on the Mt. Washington Road, a portion of which
is called the East Street.</p>

<h4><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>From Massachusetts</h4>

<p>Follow Rt 23/41 through South Egremont, where Rt 41 branches off
to the right (south). Almost immediate the Mount Washington Road
(clearly signed) branches off to the right. After 8 miles a road
branches off to the right going to Bish Bash Falls and Copake Falls
(again, clearly signed). Continue straight ahead past it. After
about a mile the Mt. Washington State Forest Headquarters is
reached, it has a large parking lot and is the trailhead for the
Alander Mountain Trail.</p>

<p>The Mount Frissell trailhead is further south (my guess from the
map is about 2&frac12; miles) just beyond the state line. The Jeep
Road starts about 1.2 miles south of the state border.</p>

<h4><a name="tocref13" id="tocref13"></a>From Connecticut</h4>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: This road is unplowed and closed in winter.</p>

<p>Take Factory Street (also known as Washinee Street) about 0.1
miles south of the junction of Rts 41 and 44 in Salisbury. After
about half a mile bear left on the Mount Riga Road, following it
for about three miles. Then turn right onto the Mount Washington
Road. Follow that road for 3.3 miles to the state line for the
Mount Frissell Trail, or 2.1 miles to the jeep road.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref14" id="tocref14"></a>Undermountain Trail</h3>

<p>The trailhead is on the west side of CT 41, about 3.5 miles
north of Salisbury.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref15" id="tocref15"></a>South Taconic Trail</h3>

<p>Drive on NY 22 either 5.5 miles north of the traffic light in
Millerton, or 7.5 miles south from the intersection with Rt 344 to
Copake Falls. Then go east on White House Crossing Street and drive
to its end. Here take a left on Rudd Pond Road, and after 0.3 miles
take a right onto Deer Run Road into a residential development
(Rudd Farms). Take a left on to Quarry Hill Road and follow it to a
small parking area at the edge of the woods.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref16" id="tocref16"></a>Resources</h2>

<p>I have made no effort to produce a comprehensive list of
resources, and have just listed books, maps and web sites that I
have actually used myself.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref17" id="tocref17"></a>Books</h3>

<ul>

<li><i>Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail Guide</i>, 7<sup>th</sup>
edition, Appalachian Mountain Club Books, Boston, MA ISBN
1-878239-39-2. Has good descriptions of all the trails described here,
as well as a map that is adequate, even though it looks old fashioned
by today's standards.  The recently published 8<sup>th</sup> edition
(now called the <i>Massachussetts Trail Guide</i>, ISBN 1-92917344-X)
has essentially the same text, but a very much improved maps.</li>

<li><i>Highpoints of the United Sates: A Guide to the Fifty State
Summits</i> by Don W. Holmes, University of Utah Press, ISBN
0-87480-645-3. Describes the standard route and the alternate one
from Mount Washington Road.</li>

<li><i>Highpoint Adventures</i> by Charlie and Diane Winger, CMC
Press, ISBN 0-9671466-3-1. Describes only the standard
route.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref18" id="tocref18"></a>Maps</h3>

<ul>

<li>If you have the 7<sup>th</sup> edition of the <i>AMC Massachusetts
and Rhode Island Trail Guide</i> the map that comes with it is
adequate.  The map that comes with the new (June 2004) 8<sup>th</sup>
edition is excellent</li>

<li>An excellent stand alone map is the
<a href="http://nynjtc.org/">NY NJ Trail Conference's</a> <i>South
Taconic Trails</i> map, ISBN 1-880775-16-6. It is the only map
which gives the color of the blazes on each trail.</li>

<li>A prettier (but not more useful!) map is the <i>South Taconic
Range</i> map published by the
<a href="http://www.bnrc.net">Berkshire Natural Resources
Council</a>, I cannot find an ISBN on my copy or on their web
site!</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref19" id="tocref19"></a>Online Resources</h3>

<p>There are many highpointer trip reports on the
