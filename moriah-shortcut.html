<div id="main">


<p>A very nice loop can be made by going up Mt. Moriah by the Stony
Brook Trail, off Rt. 16, and descending by the Carter-Moriah Trail to
Bangor Road in Gorham.  With two cars that is a very easy car
spot. For the hiker with one car it is much less attractive, as the
driving route goes through Gorham, then about half a mile east along
Rt. 2, before turning west for another half mile on Bangor Road.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is a short cut which, by my estimate, cuts almost
a mile off that route.  From the Bangor Road trailhead go northeast
for a short distance (three or four houses, as I recall) and you will
find a pedestrian path that goes west to a suspension bridge over the
Peabody River.  After crossing the river go southwest along Mill Road
which swings west for a short distance before reaching Rt. 16 just
north of a sign which reads "Libby Memorial Reacreation Area" or
something very similar.  From there it is about 1&frac12; miles to the
Stony Brook trailhead.</p>

<p>In the opposite direction, walk north along Rt. 16 for about
1&frac12; miles to the "Libby Memorial Reacreation Area" sign and take
the road east for a short distance until it swings northeast.  Follow
it until you see the suspension bridge to the east, cross the bridge
and go south on Bangor Road for a short distance to your car.</p>

<p>The map below, with the shortcut shown in black, should make this
clear.</p>
