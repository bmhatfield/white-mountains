<p>The winter of 2003-2004 has seen some amazing accomplishments in
the mountains of New England. These started immediately after
Christmas, when <a href="winter-record.html">Sue Johnston and Bob
Williams</a> embarked on an ambitious attempt to do all 48 of the
White Mountains 4,000 footers on successive days. In late January <a
href="thom-davis.html">Thom Davis</a>, who had started out with
them, finished the list in slightly over one month. Then at the end of
February two more remarkable achievements took place: on the
28<sup>th</sup> Sue and Bob, together with Jeffrey Silveira, did all
five Vermont 4,000 footers in a day, and on the 29<sup>th</sup> Tim
Seaver did a modified <a href="death-marches.html#HutTraverse">hut
traverse</a> in just under 19 hours.</p>

<p>That winter there were also two achievements that, while not
records, deserve to be recorded here. On January 18<sup>th</sup>
Brutus the Newf was the first dog to complete the New Hampshire
4,000 footers in winter, with Kevin Rooney, his human hiking
companion. And on March 4<sup>th</sup> Lyn Beattie and Ed Robertson
were the third and fourth people to complete the NH 200 Highest
peaks list in winter.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Vermont Winter 4,000 Footers
in a Day</h2>

<p>On February 28<sup>th</sup> Sue Johnston, Bob Williams and
Jeffrey Silveira (Sir Edmund on the boards) climbed
<a href="http://www.viewsfromthetop.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;t=1769">
all five Vermont 4,000 footers</a>. As far as I am aware this is
the first time that all five peaks have been climbed on a single
winter day, they took 14:50 (including driving time between
mountains). The total distance was about 20 miles, with slightly
less than half the distance on ski slopes. Lots of butt sliding
(known technically as glissading!) down black diamonds apparently
provided a lot of fun, as well as great speed! (Since writing the
above I have received an email from Sue in which she says: "Really
the only peak that the butt sliding may have saved a teeny bit of
time was the Killington black diamond. On the other peaks, I
could've run down them faster in summer, so I still think it's
faster (for me) in summer.")</p>

<h2><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Tim Seaver Does a Modified
24 Hour Winter Hut Traverse (twice!!)</h2>

<p>Early in the winter Tim Seaver, who currently holds the record
for the fastest time for the New Hampshire 4,000 Footers (in
summer) floated the idea, on the bulletin boards, of attempting a
winter hut traverse. Many, myself included, were pretty sure that
it could not be done.</p>

<p>On February 29<sup>th</sup> he set out to attempt an
<a href="http://www.vermontphoto.com/wildwhites/winterhuttohut/index.htm">
Open Hut Solo Traverse</a>, going from Carter Notch Hut, via
Zealand Hut, to Lonesome Lake Hut, in 18 hours and 58 minutes. It
is essentially a full hut traverse without Madison Hut, an amazing
accomplishment in an amazing winter!</p>

<p>A couple of weeks later he <a
href="http://www.vermontphoto.com/wildwhites/winterhuttohut/team_hike.htm"
>repeated the feat</a> with a friend, identified only as Hiker "X", in
just a shade under 24 hours (23:41!).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Ed Robertson and Lyn Beattie
Finish NH 200 Highest</h2>

<p>On March 4<sup>th</sup> Ed Robertson and Lyn Beattie completed
the New Hampshire 200 Highest peaks list in winter. Little has been
written about their exploit other than an email with subject
<a href="nh-200-highest-winter.html">Congratulations to Lyn and
Ed</a> sent out by Ed Hawkins to many of his hiking friends. I have
reproduced it with his permission,</p>

<p>The New Hampshire 200 highest list is one of the more obscure
peakbagging lists. The NH 3,000 footer list has a little over 170
peaks, and once people starting completing it they sought to extend
it. The additional peaks are either all, or almost all (I have not
seen it myself), above 2,900 feet, many are in very remote parts of
the state, with interesting access problems in winter.</p>

<p>Both of them had finished the NH 3,000 footers in 2002. Lyn was
the first woman to finish both lists.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Brutus the Newf Finishes
Winter Fours</h2>

<p>There was also a canine first completion this winter, as on
January 18<sup>th</sup> Brutus the Newf became the first dog to
complete the Winter Fours on
<a href="http://appalachia.outdoors.org/bbs/messageview.cfm?catid=7&amp;threadid=4616">
Mount Pierce</a>. The Four Thousand Footer Committee gives patches
to <a href="http://amc4000footer.org/faq.htm#app3">dogs</a>,
"assuming of course that they (or their human representative) pay
the application fee."</p>
