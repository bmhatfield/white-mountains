<h1>Mount Washington by the Ammonoosuc Ravine and Jewell Trails</h1>

<p>On the morning of Sept. 18<sup>th</sup> 2002 I drove to the
Ammonoosuc Ravine trailhead with very vague plans. I had never been
up the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail, though I had gone down it once. I
also was thinking of bagging Mount Monroe for my current round of
Trailwrights peakbagging, though peakbagging is now a low priority
for me.</p>

<p>For those who want a map I have included a link to a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4904618&amp;e=314453&amp;s=50&amp;symshow=n">
Topozone map of the western slopes of Mount Washington</a>.</p>

<p>The Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail starts off very gently, following
the south bank of the Ammonoosuc River to Gem Pool (which is indeed
a gem!) where it crosses the river. Here its nature changes
radically. It rises steeply, in fact <i>very</i> steeply, going
over an enormous number of stone steps. There is a fairly long
section which is very steep but has good footing, ideal for an
aerobic workout! Then there is a section in which the trail goes
over several ledges, since they were dry going up them was quite
easy. Following the trail required some thought at times as the
blazes on the rocks are a bit sparse, and also because the morning
sun was right in my eyes when looking up the trail, which heads
almost due east. I never really wandered off trail, so I suppose
that the blazing was adequate.</p>

<p>Halfway up the trail it was clear that this was going to be a
spectacular late summer (almost fall!) day. Clearly something more
than a quick trip up and down Mount Monroe was called for.
Something that would keep me above treeline for a few hours. I
started thinking of going south on Crawford's Path to Mount
Eisenhower, then descending by Edmands Path and either thumbing a
ride or walking back.</p>

<p>Then I met a several people, all were planning to do the classic
Mount Washington loop, going up by the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail and
down by the Jewell Trail. I had never done that loop, which is a
White Mountain classic, so I decided to do it.</p>

<p>It took me roughly a couple of hours to reach the Lakes of the
Clouds Hut, which was closed for the season. With the hut closed
the area was deserted, all hikers continuing up the Crawford Path
to the summit of Mount Washington. Quite a contrast from the summer
season, when many refer to these lakes as "Lakes of the
Crowds"!</p>

<p>The Crawford Path climbs over rocks from the hut to the summit
of Mount Washington, which has the nickname "The Rock Pile". But
whereas the Tuckerman's Ravine Trail above the headwall is a cross
between a Class 1 trail and a Class 2 scramble over talus, the
Crawford Path is a good trail all the way. I stopped many times on
the way up just to enjoy the views. I specially enjoyed the brown
sedges, they give a wonderful fall feeling to the above treeline
zone.</p>

<p>There were people at the summit, of course. Both the summit
stage and the cog railway were still running, and there were a few
hikers. But on a weekday after Labor Day it is obvious that the
crowds were gone. While in the summit building I looked at the
weather display from the Observatory, the temperature was 50&deg;F,
with winds of 8 mph, gusting to 13.</p>

<p>At the summit I had a lasagna and sat at a table with a view to
the north, including Mount Clay. I also need Mount Clay for my
Trailwrights list, so it seemed like a good idea to go and bag it.
That would also keep me above treeline for a longer time. Sitting
in the cafeteria I clearly saw two knobs on Mount Clay, but the map
only showed a broad area over 5,500 feet. The solution was obvious:
go over both knobs! From the second knob I could quite easily go
straight down (west) to the Gulfside Trail, how environmentally
acceptable that was would depend on how easy it would be to stay on
rocks rather than trample the delicate alpine vegetation.</p>

<p>The Trinity Heights Connector and Gulfside trails descend from
the summit of mount Washington to the col between it and Mount
Clay, and in the col the Mount Clay Loop branches off to loop over
Mount Clay. This entire section of the trail (about 1.8 miles) goes
along the upper edge of the Great Gulf. The Great Gulf is an
awesome structure, a deep U-shaped glacial excavation with
extremely steep walls. The Great Gulf Trail angles up the least
steep path out of the gulf, yet still manages to rise 1,600 feet in
0.8 miles!</p>

<p>On reaching the second (northmost) knob of Mount Clay I decided
to return by the long way, going down to the Gulfside Trail near
Sphinx Col. For a couple of minutes I thought of adding Mount
Jefferson to the trip, but was not sure I had enough strength or
daylight to do so. So from Sphinx col I went back up the Gulfside
Trail to the Jewell Trail (about 400 feet). The entire section from
the summit of Mount Washington over Mount Clay and back to the
Jewell Trail was over, by and large, well graded rocks.</p>

<p>The Jewell Trail is probably the gentlest trail up (or down) Mt.
Washington. It has easy grades and relatively good footing. Going
down the first 0.7 miles are above treeline, when I entered the
trees I found that I had spent 4&frac12; hours above treeline. The
trip down to the car was pleasant but anticlimactic after that long
stay above the trees.</p>

<p>What encouraged me to wander was the beauty of the day, sunny,
cool but not cold, and winds at 8 mph, gusting to 13 mph!
&ldquo;Not all those who wander are lost&rdquo;!</p>
