<p>This site is primarily about bagging the four thousand footers
in Northern New England (New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont).
Nonetheless, since peakbagging in the Northeast began in the
Adirondacks it seems appropriate to note that history. And since
many hikers will eventually hike beyond New England, lists of peaks
in other parts of the country have been briefly noted.</p>

<p>This site is mainly about the mountains themselves, not my personal
perspectives on them. The <a href="articles.html">Articles</a> section
has some more personal items, including a short essay on <a
href="whybag.html">my perspective on peakbagging</a>, with some notes
on why some people stop after completing one list while others keep on
collecting lists.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>The Adirondacks</h2>

<p>Peakbagging in the Northeast began in the Adirondacks, with
Robert and George Marshall and their guide, Herbert Clark. The
brothers started climbing in 1916, when Robert was 16 and George 13
years old. At some stage they decided to climb all the peaks above
4,000 feet, and came up with a list of 46 peaks. Only about half of
the peaks had trails, and some had probably never been climbed
before. They finished their quest in 1925. Gradually other
Adirondack hikers started on that quest, and an
<a href="http://www.adk46r.org">Adirondack Forty-Sixers Club,</a>
(separate from the <a href="http://www.adk.org/">Adirondack
Mountain Club</a>) came into existence.</p>

<p>The criterion used by the Marshall brothers and Herb Clark was
that each peak be at least 0.75 miles distant from the nearest
higher summit, or that it rise at least 300 vertical feet on all
sides. More recent surveys have shown that several of these peaks
do not reach 4,000 feet, but the original list is still the one
used by the Adirondack 46rs.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>The Four Thousand Footer
Committee Lists</h2>

<p>In 1957 the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) established a Four
Thousand Footers Committee (FTFC) that drew up a list of the 4,000
footer peaks in the White Mountains (NH). The criterion used by the
AMC FTFC to define a "peak" is that it must rise 200 feet above the
low point of its connecting ridge with a higher neighbor. There are
many "peaks" which reach 4,000 feet but do not qualify because of
this criterion, they include Clay, Little Haystack, Guyot amongst
others.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3a" id="tocref3a"></a>The Official FTFC
Lists</h3>

<p>The FTFC now recognizes three official lists of peaks: the
<a href="nh-4000-footers.html">White Mountain 4,000 Footers</a>,
the <a href="ne-4000-footers.html">New England 4,000 Footers</a>
and the <a href="ne-hundred-highest.html">New England Hundred
Highest Peaks</a>. The lists are periodically revised to reflect
the information on the most current maps. Note that all the peaks
on the two "New England" lists are in New Hampshire, Maine and
Vermont, none of the southern New England peaks qualifies for those
lists. Massachusetts has two 3000 footers, Connecticut and Rhode
Island have none.</p>

<p>In addition, Winter awards are given to those who climb all
peaks of a list during calendar winter. Obviously far fewer people
complete the lists in winter than in the other seasons. Look at the
<a href="completers.html">numbers of hikers</a> completing each
list to see!</p>

<p>The awards are given out at a meeting usually held in mid-April. In
recent years it has been held at the Cooperative Middle School in
Stratham, NH (near Exeter).</p>

<p>A letter to the Committee with a self addressed stamped envelope
will (maybe after some delay) bring the official list of peaks and
the rules. Normally only the list of White Mountain peaks is sent,
if you wish to receive the list of NE 4000 footers, and/or the list
of NE 100 Highest peaks, please ask for them explicitly.</p>

<p>The address of the 4,000 footer committee is:<br />
<br />
AMC Four Thousand Footer Committee,<br />
PO Box 444,<br />
Exeter NH 03833-0444.</p>
<br />

<p>There are maintained trails to the summits of all the New
England 4,000 footers. On the other hand many of the peaks on the
Hundred Highest list do not have trails, and require skill in the
use of map and compass. A photocopied pamphlet describing routes to
the trailless peaks on the NE Hundred Highest list is available
from the Committee for $3. A set of black-and-white USGS maps
covering these peaks (printed out from Maptech CDs) is an
additional $2.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Unofficial FTFC Lists</h3>

<p>Members of the FTFC have compiled lists of peaks (using the FTFC
definition) above 3,000 feet in each of the New England states,
though these lists are not officially maintained by the Committee.
A list of the Hundred Highest peaks in NH is also maintained. Many
of these peaks have no trails, and many are in remote areas.</p>

<p>Gene Daniell (Secretary of the FTFC) wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As to NE 3000 lists (etc.) they are not officially recognized
and it is the policy of the 4000 Footer Committee to urge folks who
have such lists to distribute them sparingly. At least half of the
NE 3000 Footers are trailless and seldom-visited, and we do not
wish to make climbing them the next fad. Unless you are the sort of
person who gets off on crashing through impenetrable scrub to get
to a viewless summit just because you like to go to places off the
beaten path, please leave this activity to those possessed by that
peculiar sort of insanity.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Therefore I am not posting any such lists on this site.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Routes to the Peaks</h3>

<p>The guidebooks describe the various trails, they do not (in most
cases) help you choose the most suitable trail to get to a summit.
I have put together some <a href="nhnotes.html">notes on routes to
the NH peaks</a>, in which I discuss the various options for
getting to each of the NH Fours during the normal hiking season
(Memorial Day to Columbus Day).</p>

<h2><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>The Northeast 111 List</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amc4000footer.org/ne111.htm">Northeast
111</a> list consists of all the 4,000 footers in the Northeast. It
includes the Adirondack 46rs list (46 peaks), the New England 4,000
Footers (initially 63, now 67 peaks) and the two 4,000 footers in the
Catskills (Slide, 4,180' and Hunter, 4,040'). The initial total was
111 peaks, and the Club has kept that name, though the total is now
115 peaks.</p>

<p>The address of the 111<sup>er</sup> committee is:<br />
<br /> Mike Dickerman<br />
P.O. Box 385<br />
Littleton, NH 03561<br /><br />
or you can <a href="mailto:bondclif@ncia.net">email</a> the commitee.</p>
