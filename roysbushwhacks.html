Some people never bushwhack, others only do so on trail-less peaks.
More adventuresome souls will bushwhack to save distance and/or
elevation (Bonds), or to avoid stream crossings (Owlshead, Twins).
The real bushwhackers bushwhack because they enjoy it, and Roy
Schweiker is a prime example of that group. He was kind enough to
send me the following notes. You may also want to see other
contributions on the
<a href="http://www.voy.com/76694/18.html">Peakbagger's Forum</a>.
Please feel free to add your own experiences there. Perhaps some of
these will later be included in this (or another) page. 

<p>The text that follows is from Roy, and "I" refers to him.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Why Bushwhack When There Are
Trails?</h2>

<p>As to why people bushwhack to peaks that have trails, some do it
because it may be easier than the trail under certain conditions,
some do it for variety after they have done all the trails enough
times, and some do it as a spirit of adventure. There is little
doubt that the most ambitious 4000-footer bushwhackers were the
late Guy Waterman and his cronies, as Guy climbed each 4000-footer
in winter from each of the 4 directions which a glance at a map
shows probably involved about 100 bushwhack routes. If anyone has a
description of the routes he used, we'd be delighted to see it.</p>

<p>In some cases, the Forest Service has paid the ultimate
compliment to former bushwhack routes as trails now follow them,
such as the first .8 mile of the Garfield Trail relocated to avoid
a brook crossing and the new Kilkenny Ridge Trail from Bunnell
Notch over Cabot to Unknown Pond.</p>

<p>People climbing 4000-footers in winter in the 1970's were
bushwhackers by necessity. There were almost no paint blazes then
and many trails were not well cleared, and with weeks or months
between ascents of the less popular peaks there might be no hint of
a broken trail. It was almost expected that the leader of a winter
trip would preview the route the previous fall and memorize its
twists and turns, along with taping orange survey flags on
overhanging spruce branches. Even so, when the day came and the
trail was not broken out, it was often quicker to bushwhack
straight toward the ultimate destination or an obvious waypoint
rather than waste time hunting for a trail that was no easier once
you found it. Of course, winter bushwhacking has the advantage over
summer bushwhacking that much of the debris on the ground is buried
and you just find a route one way and can follow your tracks
back.</p>

<p>Bushwhacking is a particular advantage to large groups of varied
abilities. The Black Pond bushwhack to Owls Head is quite easy to
find and in a group only one person has to find it and the others
just tag along. Doing the brook crossings has an increased chance
of someone falling in as group size increases, which depending on
group dynamics means some or all must turn back. Many of the routes
listed below were done with A.M.C. groups of up to 20 people;
without attempting to list all the leaders and co-leaders involved
some of the most prominent were Bob Wagner, Dick Stevens, Gene
Daniell, and Frank Pilar.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Bushwhacks in the Pemi and
Along its Rim</h2>

<p>I think the most-often-bushwhacked 4000-footer is OWLS HEAD.
Only on my first trip before the beavers flooded out Camp 9 did I
use only trails. The bushwhack by Black Pond or Franconia Falls is
so common that I wonder when they will build a trail.</p>

<p>For a comparison of the time involved with these bushwhack
routes to OWLS HEAD without snow, one day I left the parking lot a
few minutes after a group of 3 and I did the Black Pond bushwhack
while they used the trail. I reached the base of the slide first as
they removed boots for one crossing. I hiked with them up and down
the slide, but did the Franconia Falls bushwhack while they again
used the trail, and reached the parking lot just ahead of them.</p>

<p>I have bushwhacked down beside the slide and up near the Owls
Head in winter. The most underused route is up from Franconia Brook
near Redrock Brook, this is actually about a mile shorter each way
than Black Pond as you will discover if you measure it. One winter
a woman followed our tracks up and was on the summit in 4 hours
from the road, at the speed she skied by going out she might have
done the round trip in 6 hours. (She was rushing back for a date
that evening, I hope it was hot-tubbing not dancing.) Another
winter a large group went up the slide and some went back that way
and some down to Franconia Brook. The Franconia Brook group got to
the parking lot first, but I rode up with somebody from the other
group and got chilly waiting so walked back in to meet them, met
them at Black Pond Trail junction. Yet one more bushwhack route is
Beth Ruskai's all-ski ascent from the col to the NW, which took 2
days.</p>

<p>I have never bushwhacked CARRIGAIN but descents via Vose Spur or
The Captain are routine.</p>

<p>I have done the Arrow Slide up HANCOCKS and someday hope to go
up from the notch by Huntington. Other people have gone down via NW
Hancock, a peak strangely omitted from the Trailwrights list.</p>

<p>I have bushwhacked N TWIN from Peak above the Nubble but not S
TWIN.</p>

<p>I have bushwhacked GALEHEAD from Garfield Ridge/Gale River
junction, the trail is twice as long but faster.</p>

<p>Gene Daniell led a hike to GARFIELD using the abandoned trail by
Hawthorne Falls.</p>

<p>A lot of people used to reach Owls Head by going down the slide
from LINCOLN-LAFAYETTE col. Guy Waterman led a winter school trip
up LAFAYETTE via Lafayette Brook. Richard Clark &amp; I descended
LINCOLN via the W ridge in winter, the pesky scrub at the top was
buried then open woods to the brook where we found a logging
road.</p>

<p>I have bushwhacked to LIBERTY-FLUME col from near the Flume,
someday will try slide up face of Flume.</p>

<p>Bushwhacked ZEALAND from Little River to Guyot col (including
one winter hike starting &amp; finishing in daylight), Hal Graham
has done NW ridge.</p>

<p>Have done HALE via abandoned fire warden's trail, all 3 times I
couldn't find the beginning and had to bushwhack and hit it higher
up. Also bushwhacked HALE over East Hale once.</p>

<p>Never bushwhacked on FIELD &amp; WILLEY, climbed TOM from
Zealand side via Mt Field &amp; Mt Tom snowmobile trails.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.voy.com/76694/17.html">BOND</a> as stated I
have done only twice all trail, once including Twins and both times
ending at Zealand Road. I went up to the W BOND-BOND col once from
the N, and up twice and down 3 times to the S. I have done the W
ridge of W BOND up and down, the SW side of BONDCLIFF up and down,
and down from the BOND-BONDCLIFF col. Last summer I finally got up
BOND from the E. Guy Waterman has done W BOND up one of the slides
to the S.</p>
