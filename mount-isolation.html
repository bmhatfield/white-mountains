<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.21457&lon=-71.30964&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Isolation</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4893801&amp;e=315222&amp;s=250&amp;size=l&amp;datum=nad83&amp;layer=DRG100">
TopoZone map</a> of this section of the White Mountains of New
Hampshire.</p>

<h2>Shelters and Established Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The WMNF has three sites in this region that may be used on
trips to Isolation. None charge fees, no reservations are
allowed.</p>

<ul>

<li>Rocky Branch Shelter #2 is located on the Rocky Branch trail
immediately after it has crossed the Rocky Branch [ow: 3.7 miles,
1,900 feet, 2:50].</li>

<li>Just before the Rocky Branch trail crosses the stream there is
a primitive (no platforms, no outhouse) campsite.</li>

<li>A similar campsite is found at the first junction of the
Isolation trail and the Davis Path [ow: 6.4 miles, 2,950, 4:40].
Water can be difficult to find here without a long trip down the
Isolation trail towards the Dry River.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routes to Mount Isolation</h2>

<p>There are several ways of getting to Mt. Isolation, none of them
short. The longest (but with the least elevation gain) is a round
trip from the <b>Rocky Branch Trail</b> (starting from Rt. 16) to
the <b>Isolation Trail</b> to the <b>Davis Path</b> [rt: 14.6
miles, 3,400 feet, 9:00]. The stream crossings may be difficult at
high water, and there is a short (250 feet) climb on the way back
which, at the end of the day, is most unwelcome.</p>

<p>Many hikers are tempted to do a shorter trip by the <b>Glen
Boulder Trail</b> and <b>Davis Path</b> [rt: 12.0 miles, 5,050
feet, 8:30]. While it is 2.6 miles shorter I believe that the 1,650
extra feet of elevation gain (including 1,500 feet on the way back)
make it far more strenuous. The views along the Glen Boulder Trail
are great, there are no views along the Rocky Branch Trail (except
at the summit, which has great views).</p>

<p>With two cars, or the willingness to thumb a ride, an excellent
traverse may be made, going up the Glen Boulder Trail and exiting
with the Rocky Branch Trail [lp: 13.3 miles, 3,800 feet, 8:35].
That is my favorite route on Isolation, as you get the views on the
Glen Boulder Trail, but do not have the big climb on the way
back.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the three routes to Mt. Isolation:</p>
<br />

<div class="C">
<table cellspacing="0" border="3" cellpadding="3">
<caption>Routes to Mount Isolation</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Route</th>
<th>Distance</th>
<th>Elevation Gain</th>
<th>Book Time</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="L">Round trip by Rocky Branch</td>
<td>14.6</td>
<td>3,400</td>
<td>9:00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="L">Round trip by Glen Boulder</td>
<td>12.0</td>
<td>5,050</td>
<td>8:30</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="L">Traverse, Glen Boulder to Rocky Branch</td>
<td>13.3</td>
<td>3,800</td>
<td>8:35</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
<br />

<p>For backpackers the best way is by the Rocky Branch both ways.
There is a shelter after the first crossing of the river at 3.7
miles, and there are primitive campsites just before the crossing.
There are also primitive campsites at the junction of the Isolation
trail with the Davis path at 6.4 miles, water may be difficult to
find nearby.</p>

<p>In winter, when the deep snow covers the low scrub, some people
do Isolation as a <a href="isolation-bushwhack.html">bushwhack</a>,
I have not yet tried it, may do so one winter.</p>
