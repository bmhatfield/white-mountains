<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>I have a fairly large collection of hiking maps of New England, I
hope that others will find this information useful.  As a first step I
am describing maps that cover the WMNF plus the AT north of Mount
Moosilauke, the area covered by the <i>White Mountain Guide</i>.  I
hope to add similar pages on southern New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine
later.  I will not describe the various USGS quads (topos), but only
the many maps derived from them.  Note that topographic maps are
almost essential for bushwhacks.  I have acquired almost all of these
maps from <a href="http://www.mountainwanderer.com">The Mountain
Wanderer</a> map and bookstore in Lincoln, NH.</p>

<p>I have not included maps of the area covered by the <i>Southern
New Hampshire Trail Guide</i> (Cardigan, Monadnock, Wapack Trail,
Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, Castle in the Clouds).</p>

<p>For each map I will describe:</p>

<ul>

<li>Material, is the map waterproof or not. I find waterproof maps
useful even at home, as they are more resistant to the wear that
comes from repeated use.</li>

<li>Dimensions (folded).</li>

<li>Scale.</li>

<li>Contour Interval.</li>

<!--
<li>Lat/Long and UTM information. <b>I need help here!</b> What to
call the stuff, and what information to give. Presence or absence
of grid lines will be discussed under this item, they are essential
for aligning a compass!</li>
-->

<li>Coverage</li>

<li>Price (when known).</li>

<li>Special Features unique to that map, whether I like them or
not.</li>

<li>What I like (and dislike): This is very personal. What I call
clutter others consider useful detail; I hate metric contours while
others find them inoffensive.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Maps of the Whole State</h2>

<p>I will describe these much more briefly than the hiking maps, as
I use them mainly for driving or for general geographic
orientation.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Official New Hampshire Road
Map</h3>

<p>This map is available (free) at all rest stops on major highways
and is the basic driving map for the state.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>DeLorme New Hampshire Atlas
and Gazetteer</h3>

<p>Useful for trailheads that are on lesser roads. The roads to
most of the major trailheads in the White Mountains are well shown
on the hiking maps, outside the White Mountains the atlas becomes
much more useful. 80 pages, $19.95.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Topaz Maps Outdoor Travel
Series: New Hampshire</h3>

<p>An excellent overview of recreational areas in the entire state,
I find it very useful when reading about an area that I am not
familiar with. Printed on waterproof material, 4" by 9" folded,
$8.95</p>

<h2><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Maps of the White Mountain
National Forest</h2>

<p>Here I will describe maps that cover all (or most) of the White
Mountains, in the order in which I use them.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>AMC Maps</h3>

<p>These are my constant hiking companions! They are available as a
set of three paper maps (included with <i>White Mountain Guide</i>)
or four Tyvec maps (sold separately). The set of 4 maps consists
of:</p>

<ul>

<li>Map 1: Presidential Range, with a large-scale inset of the
Northern Presidentials along with general hiking info, phone
numbers and resources on the reverse side.</li>

<li>Map 2: Franconia/Pemigewasset, with larger-scale maps of
Franconia Notch and Waterville Valley on the reverse side.</li>

<li>Maps 3 and 4: Crawford Notch-Sandwich Range and
Moosilauke-Kinsman.</li>

<li>Maps 5 and 6: Carter-Range-Evans Notch and North
Country-Mahoosuc.</li>
</ul>

<p>They all share the same features, except for the scale. For the
paper set maps 1 and 2 are combined, with the larger scale maps and
the text on the reverse sides of the tyvec maps omitted. There is
considerable overlap between maps.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 3½" by 4¾".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:95,000, except for Presidentials, 1:47,500.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 100 feet.</li>

<li>Coverage: Most of the hiking areas north of Rt 25 and 25A. The
AT south of 25A is not covered, and the Nash Stream Forest is only
covered slightly to the north of Percy Peaks.</li>

<li>Price: $7.95 per map, or $27 for the set of four maps.</li>

<li>Special Features: Accurate location of trails based on GPS
data.</li>

<li>What I like: These are my favorite hiking maps. I like the
small size (they fit into the small pocket of my pouch), the
accuracy of trails and the general lack of clutter.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Most expensive (but worth it), would prefer
larger scale, multiple maps make identifying distant peaks more
difficult.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>National Geographic (Trails
Illustrated) Maps</h3>

<p>A set of two maps covering the White Mountain National Forest
printed on waterproof material:</p>

<ul>

<li>Franconia Notch/Lincoln</li>

<li>Presidential Range/Gorham</li>
</ul>

<p>The maps are both in the same format, with minimal overlap. They
were produced in partnership with the AMC, and use the AMC GPS data
for trails. Both share the same features:</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4" by 9".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:63,360.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 50 feet.</li>

<li>Coverage: The whole AT from Hanover to Grafton Notch (AT south
of the Dartmouth Skiway area is in an insert). To the south some
parts of the Squam Lake trails are missing, to the north the entire
Nash Stream Forest is missing.</li>

<li>Price: $9.95 each.</li>

<li>Special Features: Accurate location of trails based on the AMC
GPS data, some Forest Service XC ski trails, summary information on
trails.</li>

<li>What I like: These have become my favorite maps at home. I like
the accurate trails plus bigger scale than AMC maps.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Cluttered, too big to fit in my
pouch.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>White Mountains Trail Map by
Map Adventures</h3>

<p>A single two sided map printed on waterproof material.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4" by 8".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:70,000 on one side, 1:50,000 on the other side.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 20 <i>meters</i>.</li>

<li>Coverage: Limited. To the west parts of the Kinsman Ridge Trail
are missing, as is obviously the whole of Mount Moosilauke and the
AT south of it. To the south the lower part of the Algonquin Trail
is missing, as is the whole Squam Range. To the north parts of the
Randolph paths are missing, as are the entire Kilkenny, Nash Stream
Forest and Mahoosuc areas.</li>

<li>Price: $9.95</li>

<li>Special Features: Distances between trail junctions, viewpoints
marked with stars.</li>

<li>What I like: Price. The distances feature is very useful for
those who do not carry the <i>WMG</i> while hiking (almost
everyone!). Nice uncluttered look. A good map, but I own two better
sets!</li>

<li>What I dislike: Metric contours, different scales on the two
sides.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref10" id="tocref10"></a>DeLorme's Trail Map &amp;
Guide to the White Mountain National Forest</h3>

<p>The newest (2003) edition is now on waterproof material, the
whole map is on one side with <i>very</i> brief trail notes on the
back.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 6¾" by 8".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:100,000.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 100 feet.</li>

<li>Coverage: East to Moosilauke (full coverage of that mountain,
no coverage of the AT south of it). South cuts off Algonquin Trail
and whole of Squam Range. North covers Kilkenny in insert, minimal
coverage of Randolph paths, none of Mahoosucs.</li>

<li>Price: $7.95.</li>

<li>Special Features: Brief trail descriptions on back of map.</li>

<li>What I like: Single map, excellent for identifying distant peaks.
Also the map I use for <a
href="bagging2.html#tocref9">redlining</a>.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Much too big for hiking, until recently paper
only (even home copy gets worn out).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref11" id="tocref11"></a>Forest Service Map of
White Mountain National Forest</h3>

<p>The official Forest Service map, printed on ordinary paper. Like
all Forest Service maps it is not topographic (no contours), and
has miscellaneous information on the back.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4" by 9".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:126,720.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: None.</li>

<li>Coverage: Entire WMNF, partial coverage of Mahoosucs.</li>

<li>Price: WMNF sells it for $6.00, retailers add a markup.</li>

<li>Special Features: Some Forest Service roads and ski trails are
shown.</li>

<li>What I like: Nothing.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Lack of contours makes it of dubious utility to
hikers.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref12" id="tocref12"></a>Winter Trails in the White
Mountains</h3>

<p>This map (which does not really fit in any section) shows many of
the Forest Service XC ski trails, as well as a few hiking trails
described as "suitable for skiing". It has three separate maps showing
the Twin Mountain, Pinkham and trails on both sides of the Kancamagus
Highway. Unfortunately it does not show the ski trails around Smart's
Brook.  It is printed on tyvec.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4" by 9".</li>

<li>Scale: Varies between maps.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 100 feet.</li>

<li>Coverage: See above.</li>

<li>Price: $7.95.</li>

<li>Special Features: Shows ski trails not shown on most maps.</li>

<li>What I like: Best map for skiing on the major Forest Service
trails.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Does not show all the skiable old logging
roads.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref13" id="tocref13"></a>Local Maps</h2>

<p>I have quite a large collection of local maps produced by
various mountain clubs and trail associations. In the White
Mountains they add little to what is found on the major maps, but
south of the White Mountains they are the only source of accurate
trail information (the trails shown of USGS quads often bear little
resemblance to reality). I will list them in a very rough north to
south order. When the sponsoring organization has a web site I give
a link to it.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref14" id="tocref14"></a>Cohos Trail Map</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cohostrail.org">Cohos Trail
Association</a> publishes a set of nine paper maps of the trail,
which runs (or will run, it is very much a work in progress) from
the southern boundary of Cohos County to the Canadian border.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4½" by 6".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:100,000.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 20 <i>meters</i>.</li>

<li>Coverage: Entire Cohos Trail, plus proposed links to Canadian
trails.</li>

<li>Price: $12.95.</li>

<li>What I like: Only map that covers trails north of Rt 110.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Reproduction of maps not of very high
quality.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref15" id="tocref15"></a>Randolph Mountain Club
Map</h3>

<p>The full title is "Randolph Valley and the Northern Peaks of the
Mount Washington Range". An outstanding map printed on tyvec. It is
published by the
<a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/">Randolph Mountain
Club</a> both as a standalone map and in conjunction with their
<i>Randolph Paths</i> guidebook.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 3½" by 5&frac12".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:31,680.</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 50 feet.</li>

<li>Coverage: South to Sphinx Col, east to Dolly Copp campground,
north covers all RMC trails, west to Castle trailhead (lower part
of Caps Ridge Trail missing). Inserts shows Starr King Trail and
part of Kilkenny Ridge Trail to Mt. Waumbek and Owl's Head Trail
and Martha's Mile to Owl's Head and Mt. Martha.</li>

<li>Price: $5.00</li>

<li>What I like: Excellent cartography, very clear and uncluttered,
good scale for crowded trails. I always carry it when hiking in the
northern Presidentials.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Nothing to dislike.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref16" id="tocref16"></a>Bradford Washburn's Map of
the Presidential Range</h3>

<p>A classic map by a great explorer and cartographer. Very accurate,
the AMC uses it as its reference map for the area it covers,
preferring it to the USGS maps. Printed on paper (the tyvec version is
no longer available).</p>

<p>A good description of the ten year effort
(1978-1988) to develop it is given in <i>Appalachia</i>, December 1990
and June 1991.  The trails were surveyed to great accuracy using
conventional (pre-GPS) surveying tools.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4¾" by 8".</li>

<li>Scale: 1:20,000</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 50 feet, occasional intermediate contours
(dashed) at 25 feet.</li>

<li>Coverage: North to Rt 2, east to Dolly Copp campground, south
to Mount Isolation, west to Mount Pierce.</li>

<li>Price: $10.95.</li>

<li>What I like: Scale, accuracy and beautiful cartography (printed in
Switzerlan).</li>

<li>What I dislike: Not very hiker friendly, the contours labels
are a bit sparse, the detail at times overwhelming.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref17" id="tocref17"></a>Bradford Washburn's Map of
Tuckerman Ravine</h3>

<p>A highly detailed map of Tuckerman Ravine, subtitled: "For
Hikers, Skiers, Scientists."</p>

<li>Scale: 1:5,000</li>

Spur, west to Tuckerman Junction.</li>

<li>Price: $3.95</li>

<li>Special Features: Immense detail</li>

<li>What I like: Beautiful map!</li>

<li>What I dislike: Not sure what it is really useful
for.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref18" id="tocref18"></a>AMC Pinkham Notch
Area</h3>

<p>Subtitle: "Includes hiking tips, safety information, and
description of hiking and skiing trails."</p>

<ul>

<li>What I like: Detailed map of area around Pinkham Notch.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Not very useful for serious hikers.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref19" id="tocref19"></a>WMNF Mountain Bike Map,
Pemigewasset Ranger District</h3>

<p>While it is designed for mountain bikers, I have found it very
useful for snowshoeing or XC skiing as it shows many logging roads
not clearly shown on other maps. Many routes are described on the
back of the map. Printed on waterproof material.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4" by 9"</li>

<li>Scale: 1:63,360</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 20 <i>meters</i></li>

<li>Coverage: North to Garfield Ridge, east to Mount Carrigain,
south to Squam Lake, west to East Haverhill.</li>

<li>Price: WMNF sells it for $8.00, retailers add a markup.</li>

<li>Special Features: Logging roads not shown on most other
maps</li>

<li>What I like: Coverage of logging roads.</li>

<li>What I dislike: Huge size when unfolded.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tocref19a" id="tocref19a"></a>Rob Brook Area Mountain
Biking Trail Map</h3>

<p>This map was designed by Larry Garland, and has much of the look
and feel of the AMC maps. It is printed on waterproof material, and
is suitable for skiers and snowshoers as well as for mountain
bikers. Many routes are described on the back of the map.</p>

<ul>

<h3><a name="tocref26" id="tocref26"></a>Map Adventures Vermont-New
Hampshire Hiking Map</h3>

<p>One side of this map has a collection of Vermont hiking maps, and
on the other side are a pair of maps covering most of the AT from
Hanover to Kinsman Notch.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dimensions (folded): 4" by 9"</li>

<li>Scale: Not given, approximately one inch to the mile
(1:63,360)</li>

<li>Contour Interval: 20 <i>meters</i></li>

<li>Coverage: One map covers AT from Hanover to slightly before Rt
25 A, other one covers it going over Mount Moosilauke and includes
Tunnel Brook Trail.</li>

<li>Price: $4.95</li>

<li>Special Features: Brief trail descriptions</li>

<li>What I like: Coverage of AT south of Moosilauke</li>

<li>What I dislike: Metric contours</li>
</ul>
