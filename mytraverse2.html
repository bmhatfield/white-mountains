<h2><a name="trip" id="trip"></a><a name="tocref4"
id="tocref4"></a>The Traverse</h2>

<p>We started up the Valley Way at 4:45, and soon hit a comfortable
pace. The lower three miles have good footing and a (relatively)
easy grade, great for the warm up at the start of a long day. The
last pitch from the Upper Bruin to the hut was steeper and rougher,
but we cruised over it.</p>

<p>At the hut Dave and I decided not to go up Madison and waited
for Chris and Jack. We were sweaty from the hike and the hut was
rather chilly (48&deg; outside, not much warmer inside), so we put
on our fleece.</p>

<p>We all filled our water bottles, used the facilities, and were
off. I was wearing my fleece top and Goretex pants as weather was
cool and a bit windy. There is a steep section on the Gulfside as
it rises to meet the Airline, then the Airline traverses the North
slope of John Quincy Adams gradually, before attacking the main
summit more steeply. I was able to keep a good pace, it seems that
I can go <i>up</i> over rocks much more easily than I can go down.
We all reached the summit of Adams in great spirits, happy that we
had done about 5,000 vertical feet out of a total of about
8,500.</p>

<p>In retrospect I believe that we went up the Valley Way and Mt.
Adams <i>much</i> too fast. Marathoners know that they will have to
keep going for a long time, and know how to pace themselves. Many
hikers find themselves fit and full of energy at the start of the
day, and rush up the Valley Way at a pace that would be suitable
for a Madison and Adams trip. Later in the day they pay for their
poor judgment!</p>

<p>I started down Lowe's Path immediately after reaching the
summit, knowing that it would be a slow and painful descent. Sure
enough, the others started down later and passed me, we regrouped
at Thunderstorm Junction. From there the Gulfside went down to
Edmands Col easily. We had our first sit down break since the hut
there.</p>

<p>The climb from the col to the summit was steep and, for the
first time, we started feeling the cumulative effects of what was
already a long day in terms of elevation gain (5,850 feet for those
who had gone up Madison). We took a long, well earned rest, between
the two summits.</p>

<p>The descent to Sphinx Col was uneventful but slower, and we had
another sit down break at the point where the Clay Loop leaves the
Gulfside. Here Jack and I decided to stay on the Gulfside,
bypassing Clay, while Chris and Dave went over it. The savings in
distance and elevation gain were minimal, but that section of the
Gulfside has very good footing, reducing the effort quite a
bit.</p>

<p>We regrouped at the other end of the Clay Loop and had a break
during which we discussed what to do next. We were tired, not
exhausted, but were slipping behind schedule. We decided to bypass
Washington, taking the Westside trail to the Crawford Path. The
Westside trail also has excellent footing, but nevertheless we did
not go very fast. The sight of Lakes hut, getting bigger and bigger
as we approached, motivated us!</p>

<p>At the hut we had a long break, almost half an hour. We ate,
filled our water bottles, and just relaxed. It did us a lot of
good, as we all felt much better as we started the final phase of
the traverse.</p>

<p>The climb up Monroe is steep, but short, so we had little
difficulty with it. Similarly the descent from its minor summit to
Crawford Path has a very rough, but short, section. I was happy to
realize that from here onwards we would be on a trail with
<i>much</i> better footing than in the Northern Presis! Our pace
picked up considerably, and we were in great spirits as we went
over Eisenhower and down to the col between it and Pierce.
Somewhere between that col and the summit of Pierce our energy
started draining away, and by the time we were going down the
Crawford Path to the waiting car it had vanished. The last hour we
were all silent, just putting one foot in front of the other until
we reached the trailhead.</p>
