<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>


<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/me/public.html">Recreation
Report for New Hampshire and Western Maine</A> gives a two day
forecast for higher elevations (separate forecasts for elevations of
2,500 to 4,000 feet and for above 4,000 feet). There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.197&lon=-71.43458&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount
Field</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="tocref1" id="tocref1"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
TopoZone map of
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4897328&amp;e=303280&amp;s=100&amp;size=l&amp;u=0&amp;layer=DRG25">
Mounts Hale, Tom, Field and Willey</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC operates one <a href="amc-huts.html">hut</a> and one
<a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/campsites/index.cfm">backcountry
campsite</a> in this area of the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
Fees are charged at all of them, reservations are advised at the
huts, but there are no reservations at the campsites.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand Falls Hut</a> is located
near the junction of the Twinway and Zealand trails [ow: 2.8 miles,
650 feet, 1:45]. A longer approach is from Crawford Notch by the
Avalon and A-Z trails [ow: 5.5 miles, 2,000 feet, 3:45]. It is
possible to bag peaks on the way in to the hut (or out from it), or
as daytrips beginning and ending at the hut.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>The Ethan Pond campsite is reached by the Ethan Pond trail [ow:
2.6 miles, 1,450 feet, 2:00]. It has a shelter plus 3 single and 3
double platforms. It is mainly used for backcountry camping, and is
of little interest to peakbaggers.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Routes</h2>

<p>These peaks are close together, and the classic way to bag them
is to do all three of them in one trip from Crawford Notch. They
may also be done individually or in pairs, and can be approached
from Zealand Hut (or the Zealand Trail trailhead) or the Willey
House site in addition to the classic approach from the Notch. Add
the possibility of traverses or loops, and it is clear that there
are too many possibilities for all to be listed. I will therefore
only cover the most frequently used routes.</p>

<p>The many ways of incorporating these peaks in a trip to Zealand
Hut (on the way in, on the way out, as a daytrip from the hut and
back) are covered in the page on <a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand
Hut</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Mount Tom</h3>

<p>When done alone it is usually reached by the Avalon, A-Z and Mt.
Tom spur trails (rt: 5.8 miles, 2,150 feet, 4:00).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Mount Field</h3>

<p>Like Mount Tom this can be done as a single peak from either
Crawford Notch or in conjunction with a Zealand Hut trip. The
Avalon Trail goes from the Notch to the Willey Range Trail a short
distance north of the summit of Mount Field (rt: 5.6 miles, 2,400
feet, 4:00). There are good views from Mount Avalon, going up the
short but steep spur to its summit adds about 100 yards each
way.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Mount Willey</h3>

<p>When done alone Mount Willey is approached from the south, going
up the Willey Range Trail, which has very steep and rough sections.
You can start at either the Ethan Pond Trail or the Kendron Flume
Trail, the latter is steeper and rougher (rt: 5.4, 2,850, 4:10 from
Ethan Pond trailhead, add 150 feet (0:05) if starting from Kendron
Flume trailhead).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7" id="tocref7"></a>Mounts Tom and Field</h3>

<p>A very common combination, easier than many single intermediate
4,000 footers! To start with Mount Field ascend the Avalon Trail
almost to the summit, optionally (strongly recommended) taking the
short spur to Mount Avalon. Then go north along the Willey Range
Trail to its junction with the A-Z Trail, and go right (east) a
short distance to the Mount Tom Spur. After climbing Mount Tom
descend by the A-Z and Avalon trails to the trailhead (lp: 7.2
miles, 2,750 feet, 5:00).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8" id="tocref8"></a>Mounts Field and Willey</h3>

<p>These are most often done as a round trip by the Avalon and
Willey Range trails (rt: 8.4 miles, 3,050 feet, 5:45). This
involves a steep (but fairly short) climb up Mount Field on the
return trip, which can be very unwelcome!</p>

<p>An alternative, much steeper and rougher, which requires a car
spot, traverses the Willey Range rather than going in and out the
same way. Starting at the Avalon Trail, follow it to the summit of
Mount Field, then take the Willey range trail to the summit of
Mount Willey. That trail then descends (very steeply at first) to
join the Ethan Pond Trail about 1.6 miles from its start (lp: 6.9
miles, 2,700 feet, 4:50). Doing it in the opposite direction adds
450 feet of elevation gain (0:15).</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9" id="tocref9"></a>Mounts Tom, Field and
Willey</h3>

<p>Either of the two ways of doing Mounts Field and Willey can be
extended to add Mount Tom. If doing the loop from Crawford Notch,
descend from Mount Field by the Willey Range trail to its junction
with the A-Z trail, take the Mt. Tom spur to the summit and back,
and return by the A-Z and Avalon trails (lp: 10.0 miles, 3,400
feet, 6:40).</p>

<p>If doing the Willey Range traverse (assuming you start at the
notch) ascend by the Avalon and A-Z Trails to the height of land,
go up and down the Mount Tom Spur, then do the full length of the
Willey Range Trail to the Ethan Pond Trail, which will take you to
the trailhead (lp: 8.5 miles, 3,100 feet, 5:45). Doing it in the
opposite direction adds 450 feet of elevation gain (0:15).</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the distances, elevation gains and book
times of the various possible routes to the peaks of the Willey
Range (excluding routes involving
<a href="zealand-hut.html">Zealand Hut</a>, which are tabulated on
that page).</p>
