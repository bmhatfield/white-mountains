<h1>Mount Marcy (New York Highpoint) in Winter</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p>In August 2004 I hiked <a href="mount-marcy.html"></a>Mount Marcy
and decided that I wanted to return and do it in winter.  Since I very
much enjoy winter camping I had originally planned to set up a "base
camp" at Marcy Dam for a three day trip with the summit attempt on the
second day.  Over the winter I started questioning the appropriateness
of hauling the gear needed for an overnight for such a short trip (15
miles and about 3,500 feet of elevation gain), and decided to do it as
a day trip.</p>

<p>I had planed to do it "some time this winter", and suddenly I found
that the end of winter was fast approaching. Early in March I decided
that I would do it during the last week of calendar winter, and
announced it to some of my hiking companions after a hike. One of them
asked to join me; I was obviously very happy as company is always nice
on a long drive and a long hike. We decided to stay at the <a
href="http://www.adk.org/ad_loj/index.aspx">Adirondack Loj</a> for two
nights and to have dinner there both nights.</p>

<p>We reached the Loj on Wednesday March 16<sup>th</sup> shortly
before dark, and just had time to get our stuff in our bunkroom and
have some wine and cheese before the excellent dinner was
served. During dinner we got to know some of our fellow guests at the
Loj and had a pleasant conversation.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning we were the only ones signed up for early
breakfast (ready at 6 AM, including fresh brewed coffee). We were a
bit slow getting our things together, and left the Loj around 7:30,
rather than at 7:00 as planned.</p>

<p>It was my first winter trip to the Adirondacks, and my companion's
first trip there in any season. We were both surprised and delighted
to see how well packed the trails were; clearly the "snowshoes or skis
required" <a
href="http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/press/pressrel/2001/2001x81.html">policy</a>
works very well.</p>


<p>We made steady progress along the easy grade of the trail, stopping
to enjoy the views at Marcy Dam and at Indian Falls. The broadside
view of the MacIntyre range from Indian Falls is particularly
impressive; we decided then and there that we had to return next
winter to do Algonquin!  Then the trail started getting slightly
steeper, though never really steep, until we reached the Hopkins Trail
junction. Before that junction we started getting views both of Marcy
to our south and of Whiteface and the many lakes to the north.</p>

<p>Snow depths had been increasing dramatically as we gained
elevation. Low down the DEC signs were high above the ground; by the
time we reached the Hopkins junction many were at ground level. Lower
down there was almost no snow on the trees, higher up they were
covered with snow, many having huge mushroom-like caps of snow.</p>

<p>When the trail broke out of the trees it became much less distinct,
and different parties clearly went in different directions, with most
skiers opting to go substantially to hikers left (east) towards the
snow fields. We were momentarily confused, but I recognized the small
knob that the trail went over in summer, and saw a cairn on its
top. We were too far to the left to go over it, but we saw cairns a bit
higher up and headed for them. This I find interesting; I do not
remember reading anything about difficulties following the trail.</p>

<p>The snow had become much more hard packed, and for a short distance
we found ourselves wearing snowshoes in terrain where crampons would
have been more comfortable, with the terrain too steep to stop and
change. After a short and, to me, unpleasant section we reached a flat
spot and changed into crampons, which made the rest of the ascent
<i>much</i> more comfortable.</p>

<p>We reached the summit around 12:30 and had a very pleasant lunch. The
wind was, almost until we left, completely non-existent, and the sky,
which had been totally clear at Indian Falls, was just starting to
have a few small clouds. The views were spectacular, I could recognize
the main ranges and a few major individual peaks, but will really need
to spend more time in the area to become familiar with the mountains.</p>

<p>The descent to Marcy Dam was uneventful, though my muscles were
tiring, and were complaining whenever the trail was flat enough for
gravity to offer no help. Beyond Marcy Dam we had to go up several
short pitches, plus a longer pitch just before the trailhead. These
ups were most unwelcome, but we knew that we were approaching "home",
and kept going.</p>

<p>We reached the trailhead at 5:45 PM, almost exactly ten hours after
starting. I was quite tired, but a good hot shower, followed by wine
and cheese, helped me recover. We had an excellent St. Patrick's Day
dinner, and again enjoyed the company of our companions. After
breakfast next morning we said goodbye to our Loj companions, and
started the long drive home.</p>

<p>A wonderful trip! Unbelievable weather on the hike, great views along
the trail as well as on the summit, good food and good company. We
have already decided to return next year, staying three nights and
hiking two days.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: We enjoyed the Loj very much, but must note that it
was much less than half full.  We were about six or seven people in
the main 18-bed bunkroom, with lots of room for our gear.  I suspect
that with a full bunkroom we would have been much less
comfortable!</p>
