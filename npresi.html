<p> These notes are written to help you compare the various routes
that are <i>commonly</i> used to hike to the peaks.  They are written
on the assumption that you have a guidebook and a set of maps, so no
directions are given to trailheads, and the trails are not described
in any detail.  I have omitted hikes that are substantially longer or
more difficult than the standard ones, or that are simply less often
used.  The fact that a trail is not mentioned here does not imply that
it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>The <a href="washington.html#Warning">warnings</a> about weather
and strenuousness given for Mount Washington are just as applicable
to the Northern Presidentials. All are exposed, and all the routes
(except for the Caps Ridge trail to Mt. Jefferson) include
substantial elevation gains.</p>

<h2><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Mountain Weather Forecast</h2>

<p>The best forecast for Mount Washington and its neighbors is the
Mount Wasington Observatory's <a href="http://www.mountwashington.org/weather/summit_forecast.php">Higher Summits Forecast</a>. There is also a point
forecast for <a
href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.30481&lon=-71.31646&site=gyx&smap=1&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=text">Mount

<h2><a name="map" id="map"></a>Online Map</h2>

<p>If you do not have a printed map handy you may want to look at a
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4910281&amp;e=316050&amp;s=100&amp;layer=DRG25&amp;size=l&amp;u=0">
TopoZone map</a> of this section of the White Mountains of New
Hampshire.</p>

<h2><a name="tocref2" id="tocref2"></a>Huts and Established
Trailside Campsites</h2>

<p>The AMC's <a href="madison-hut.html">Madison Spring Hut</a> is
located at the end of the Valley Way [ow: 3.8 miles, 3,550 feet,
3:40]. It allows a relatively easy two day trip to both
<a href="npresi.html#MadHut">Madison and Adams</a>. It may also be used as
part of a three day (two nights) Presidential traverse, spending
the other night at Lakes of the Clouds hut.</p>

<p>The WMNF maintains two campsites and a group of primitive (no
platforms, no outhouse) camping areas in the Northern Presis. There
are no fees, and reservations are not accepted.</p>

<ul>

<li>The Valley Way campsite, situated off the Valley Way trail [ow:
3.1 miles, 2,800 feet, 3:00] has a couple of tent platforms. A
backcountry alternative to Madison hut for those who wish to do
Madison, Adams or both as an overnight trip.</li>

<li>The Osgood campsite is located near the junction of the Osgood
trail and the Osgood Cutoff [ow: 2.6 miles, 1,150 feet, 1:50]. It
has one single and two double tent platforms, with a capacity of 15
people. It is well located for those who would like to do the
Osgood trail over two days. Note that it is on the Appalachian
Trail, so it is likely to be busy when the through hikers
come!</li>

<li>Primitive campsites along the Great Gulf trail and some of the
trails that branch off it. They are shown in the new AMC map and in
the RMC map.<br />
 The two sites located at The Bluff [ow: 2.8 miles, 1,000 feet,
1:55] are an alternative to the Osgood campsite for those using the
Osgood trail. The others are well located for approaching the peaks
from the South, using the Madison Gulf, Buttress, Six Husbands or
Sphinx trails (none of which are described here, as they are not
commonly used by peakbaggers).</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="rmc"></a>The <a
href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/">Randolph Mountain Club</a>
has four shelters in the area (see <a
href="http://hikethewhites.com/photos/map_rmc.jpg">map</a>
for their locations).  Unlike the AMC huts, the RMC facilities are
open in winter.  Fees are charged at all of them (follow the link for
each shelter), and no reservations are accepted.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/sheltersinfo/logcabin.html">
Log Cabin</a>, (actually more an enclosed lean-to than a cabin)
just off Lowe's Path [ow: 2.4 miles, 1,900 feet, 2:10].</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/sheltersinfo/grayknob.html">
Gray Knob Cabin</a>, also just off Lowe's Path [ow: 3.2 miles,
3,050, 3:10]. It is a tightly insulated building, and is heated
(moderately!) with a wood stove in winter.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/sheltersinfo/theperch.html">
The Perch</a>, a lean-to with four tent platforms, situated between
the Randolph Path and the Israel Ridge Trail. It can be reached by
the Israel Ridge Path [ow: 3.7 miles, 2,800 feet, 3:15] or by
Lowe's Path and the Randolph Path [ow: 3.7 miles, 2,950 feet,
3:20].</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/sheltersinfo/cragcamp.html">
Crag Camp</a>, at the edge of King Ravine, has spectacular views
into the ravine and the knife edge of Durant Ridge. It can be
reached from Appalachia by the Airline, Short Line, Randolph Path
and Spur trails [ow: 3.3 miles, 2,900 feet, 3:05] or from Lowe's
Store by Lowe's Path and the Gray Knob trail [ow: 3.7 miles, 3,050
feet, 3:25].</li>
</ul>

<p>All four RMC facilities can be used for overnight trips to Adams
and either Madison or Jefferson, though I find the Log Cabin too
close to the road to be very useful.</p>

distances, elevation gains and book times (one way) to these

<h2><a name="tocref3" id="tocref3"></a>Routes to Summits</h2>

<h3><a name="tocref4" id="tocref4"></a>Routes to Individual Peaks
(one day)</h3>

<h4><a name="Madison" id="Madison"></a>Mount Madison</h4>

<p>There are so many possible routes to Mount Madison that it now
has a <a href="madison.html">separate page</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Adams" id="Adams"></a>Mount Adams</h4>

<p>This is the second highest peak in the White Mountains of New
Hampshire, and the one with the greatest elevation gain by any of
the standard routes. There are two direct routes: the <b>Airline
Trail</b> from the Appalachia trailhead [rt: 8.6 miles, 4,500 feet,
6:30] and <b>Lowe's Path</b> from Lowe's Store (nominal parking fee
charged at store) [rt: 9.6 miles, 4,400 feet, 7:00]. The Airline
Trail has great views down into King's Ravine from the "knife edge"
of Durant's Ridge. I put the words "knife edge" in quotes, the
exposure there is minimal, the views great.</p>

<p>The steepest part of the Airline may be bypassed by a slightly
longer path, starting up the Valley Way, then taking the <b>Scar
Trail</b> to the Airline Trail [rt: 10.0 miles, 4,500 feet,
7:15].</p>

<p>An equally scenic route, though perhaps steeper and rougher than
the others, is to go up the <b>Spur Trail</b>, reached from
Appalachia by the Amphibrach and Randolph Path, passing the
Knight's Castle, a great outlook into King's Ravine [rt: 10.4
miles, 4,400 feet, 7:25]. Look at your map to see other options for
that trip.</p>

<h4><a name="Jefferson" id="Jefferson"></a>Mount Jefferson</h4>

<p>The easiest route up Mt. Jefferson is the <b>Caps Ridge
Trail</b>, which starts at Jefferson Notch, at an elevation of
3,000 feet [rt: 5.0 miles, 2,700 feet, 3:50]. It is steep, rough,
involves scrambles over ledges, and has what some may consider an
uncomfortable degree of exposure (a <i>very</i> individual
assessment). In spite of that, it is definitely the easiest route
for those comfortable with moderate exposure.</p>

<p>All other approaches are longer, with substantially more
elevation gain. Probably the easiest way is to go up the <b>Jewell
Trail</b>, from the Base Station, to the <b>Gulfside Trail</b> to
Jefferson [rt: 11.0 miles, 4,150 feet, 7:35]. It is nowhere very
steep or rough, but is exposed to the weather for a long time.</p>

<p>From the North the most common approaches are by the <b>Castle
Trail</b> directly to the summit [rt: 10 miles, 4,200 feet, 7:05],
or by <b>Lowe's</b> and <b>Randolph Paths</b> and the Gulfside
Trail [rt: 11 miles, 4,350 feet, 7:40]. Both involve some steep
sections, and the Castle Trail involves some scrambles on the
Castles.</p>

<p>A very interesting loop can be made by going up the Caps Ridge
Trail, and descending by the Castle Trail to <b>the Link</b>, which
returns to the Caps Ridge Trail. This loop is short [lp: 6.7 miles,
2,900 feet, 4:50], but not as easy as it may seem, since this
section of the Link is very rough.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref5" id="tocref5"></a>Routes to Multiple Peaks
(one day)</h3>

<p>The summits on the main ridge are fairly close to each other,
and it is quite easy to arrange trips over more than one summit.
The ultimate route to multiple peaks is, of course, the
<a href="presidential-traverse.html">Presi Traverse</a>!</p>

<h4><a name="MadAdams" id="MadAdams"></a>Mount Madison and Mount
Adams</h4>

<p>This is a classic "big hike" for the fit. It is almost always
done as a loop from Appalachia, using the Valley Way, with or
without the Watson Path, and the Airline [lp: 10.0 miles, 5,000
feet, 7:30]. From a distance you may think that the two summits are
close together, it is 0.9 mile and 1,000 feet from Madison hut to
the summit of Mt. Adams!</p>

<p>The more ambitious may choose to go up Mount Adams from the hut
using the <b>Star Lake Trail</b>, which adds 0.1 mile.  It is steeper
and rougher than the Airline Trail, and at the end it has a section
that requires the use of one's hands for scrambling.  It is rarely
used, so even on a summer weekend you will probably be alone on that
trail (but not on the summit!).  It is not a good trail for descent; I
would suggest going down by the Airline trail.</p>

<h4><a name="JefAdams" id="JefAdams"></a>Mount Jefferson and Mount
Adams</h4>

<p>Another long and strenuous trip! One way to do it is to take
Lowe's and Randolph Paths to Edmands Col, then the Jefferson Loop
to the summit of Mt. Jefferson, return to the Col and follow the
Gulfside to Thunderstorm Junction, finally ascending Mt. Adams by
Lowe's Path. Return to the car by Lowe's Path [lp: 12.4 miles,
5,200 feet, 8:50]. It can be done equally well in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Another way is a loop from Bowman. Take the Castle trail up to
Mt. Jefferson, go to Mt. Adams as above, and return to Bowman by
the Gulfside, Israel Ridge and Castle trails [lp: 12.6 miles, 5,050
feet, 8:50].</p>

<h4><a name="Three" id="Three"></a>Mounts Madison, Adams and
Jefferson</h4>

<p>The traverse of the three northern Presidentials is a major
undertaking. The easiest way is a loop from Appalachia, going up
the Valley Way to Mt. Madison, then taking the Gulfside (looping
over Mt. Adams) to Edmands Col, up to Mt. Jefferson by the
Jefferson Loop, and back to Appalachia by the Randolph Path, Short
Line and Airline trails[lp: 13.7 miles, 5,850 feet, 9:45]. Many
other routes are obviously possible.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref6" id="tocref6"></a>Overnight Routes to
Individual or Multiple Peaks</h3>

<p>Some hikers may decide that the trips described above are a bit
more strenuous than they would enjoy. Others may just want to spend
one or more nights on the mountains. Thanks to the overnight
facilities described <a href="npresi.html#tocref2">above</a> almost all of the
single day routes (over single or multiple peaks) can be done as
overnights. A few possibilities will be described, use your map and
imagination to find many more!</p>

<h4><a name="MadHut" id="MadHut"></a>Mount Madison (and optionally
Mount Adams) using Madison Spring Hut</h4>

<p>The easiest way up is by the Valley Way, which ends at the hut.
After settling down and resting, summit Mt. Madison. Next day, if
you want to summit Mt. Adams, go up the Great Gulf trail to the
Airline trail, and follow it to the summit of Mt. Adams, and
descend by the Airline trail. Otherwise return by the Valley
Way.  The more ambitious may choose to use the Star Lake Trail.</p>

<h4>Mount Madison (and optionally Mount Adams) using the Valley Way
Campsite</h4>

<p>A very similar trip can be done using the Valley Way campsite
rather than the hut. If doing both Mts. Madison and Adams you may
return to the campsite in one of two ways. You may simply make a
round trip, up the Valley Way to the hut, then up and down Mt.
Madison, follow the Gulfside to the Airline and hence to the summit
of Mt. Adams, and retrace your path. Alternately you may descend by
the Airline Trail to its junction with the Upper Bruin trail, and
take that trail back to the Valley Way slightly above the
campsite.</p>

<h4>Mount Adams and Mount Jefferson from the RMC Facilities</h4>

<p>Excellent loop trips with much above treeline travel can be done
from either Crag Camp or Gray Knob, while trips from The Perch will
involve more backtracking.</p>

<p>If starting from Crag Camp or the Gray Knob take the Spur Trail
or Lowe's Path to the summit of Mt. Adams, then follow the Gulfside
to Edmunds Col. From there climb Mt. Jefferson by the Jefferson
Loop, and return to Edmunds Col the same way. Use Randolph Path and
the Gray Knob Trail to return.</p>

<p>From The Perch you may take the Randolph Path to Edmunds Col, go
up Mt. Jefferson and back, then follow the Gulfside and Israel
Ridge trails to the summit of Mt. Adams, returning by the Israel
Ridge trail.</p>

<h2><a name="winter"></a>The Northern Presidentials in Winter</h2>

<p>Mount Jefferson is probably the hardest 4,000 footer in winter, due
to the combination of considerable distance, elevation gain and
exposure to severe weather.  Mount Adams is easier, with less distance
and exposure to somewhat less severe weather.  Both, however, must be
considered serious endeavors, with substantial distances and elevation
gains, and a long and exposed stretch above treeline.  Note that in
all cases the "distance above treeline" in the descriptions is the
<i>one way</i> distance.</p>

<p>That long stretch above treeline, plus the summit views, make these
exhilarating trips in good weather. The major routes (Airline Trail
and Lowe's and Randolph Paths) are heavily used and so likely to be
well broken out.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref7"></a>Mt. Adams in Winter</h3>

<p>Those doing Mount Adams without Mount Madison almost always use
either the Airline Trail or Lowe's Path.  Both trails have steep
sections below treeline, which are often packed hard by glissaders and
may require crampons.  Both trails are above treeline, fully exposed
to the wind most of the time, for about 1&frac12; miles.  Here there
are sections with a treacherous mixture of bare rock, snow and
ice.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref8"></a>Mt. Jefferson in Winter</h3>

<p>Traditionally, most winter hikers attempted Mount Jefferson by the
Lowe's Path, Randolph Path, Gulfside and Mt. Jefferson Loop route.
This involves about 1.3 miles above treeline, with great exposure to
the winds.  The area around Edmunds Col is notorious for its winds;
many a disappointed winter peakbagger will tell you: "I have bagged
Edmunds Col three (or whatever the number may be) times", meaning that
s/he was unable to go beyond it.  The final climb to the summit goes
over a rather steep snowfield, be sure you know how to
self-arrest!</p>

<p>While most people do it in a single day, it can be done as an
overnight trip, spending a night at either The Perch (lean-to or tent
platform) or Gray Knob Cabin (heated cabin).</p>

<p>Now that the Cog Railway operates in winter (for skiers) and the
road to the Base Station is open many hikers will attempt Mounts
Monroe, Washington and Jefferson from the west.  They will break out
the Ammonoosuc Ravine and Jewell trails, which may make approaching
Mount Jefferson from that direction more attractive than it has been
in the past.  In summer this is a long, but relatively easy, approach,
with gentle grades to compensate for the greater distance.  Winter
hikers should note that it is above treeline for about 2&frac12;
miles, and being on the western flank of the mountain is fully exposed
to the prevailing winds.  This should only be attempted under
excellent weather conditions.</p>

<h3><a name="tocref9"></a>Multiple Northern Presidential Peaks in
Winter</h3>

<p>Mounts Adams and Madison are often climbed together in a day.
Together they make a long day with substantial exposure, but both the
distance and the severity of the weather are less than on
Mt. Jefferson alone.  As noted under <a
href="madison.html#winter">Mount Madison in winter</a> it is probably
easier to do this in a day than to carry the extra weight needed for
an overnight trip, but some people do spend the night at the Valley
Way campsite.</p>

<p>Almost everyone who attempts Mounts Adams and Jefferson on the same
trip spends at least one night on the mountain.  Most use the <a
href="npresi.html#rmc">Randolph Mountain Club facilities</a>.  Those seeking the
comfort of a moderately heated cabin will opt for the Gray Knob Cabin,
while those who prefer camping out will chose The Perch, using either
the lean-to or one of the tent platforms.</p>
