<h1>Mount Redington, Maine, by Caribou Valley Road</h1>
</div>  <!--  header div  -->

<div id="main">

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>:  This was written several years ago.  The
logging roads are unlikely to disappear, but the condition of Caribou
Valley Road varies from year to year.</p>

<p>There is a perfectly good trail to Mount Redington, however it
is not described in the guide book nor shown on any current map. I
am assuming that you have the new AMC map of the Rangeley-Stratton
area, which shows Caribou Valley Road and the first logging road
that branches off it. Alternately, you can use a
<a href="http://topozone.com/map.asp?z=19&amp;n=4985893&amp;e=392132&amp;s=50&amp;size=l">
TopoZone Map</a> of the area.</p>

<p>Drive along Caribou Valley Road about 1.1 miles beyond the AT
crossing, where you will find a wide area where you can park many
cars. The condition of logging roads can change very fast, but in
July 2001 Caribou Valley Road was quite drivable up to the AT
crossing, and definitely drivable to the parking area. We had no
problems with an SUV, and found a couple of sedans parked
there.</p>

<p>There is a fork immediately after the parking area, not shown on
the map. Take the left branch, which follows the river. In July
2001 it was marked by a cairn, but a good look at the map should
make it clear that you want to follow the river. The road
immediately crosses a tributary over a bridge that was in very bad
condition, no cars had crossed it that day. Follow the road over a
mile to a second fork, which is shown on the map. Take the right
branch, the left branch immediately goes over a bridge. Continue
through a logged bowl, and enjoy the raspberries in season! At the
next fork take the right branch (again, shown on the map with
dashed lines) and climb uphill. This is an older logging road, much
rougher than the main Caribou Valley Road. Keep going up until you
practically reach the ridgeline, you will find a very clear road
branching off to the left, there are many cairns and an arrow made
out of sticks to mark it. Towards the top of the road you will run
into several cairns on the side of the road that do not signify
anything, ignore them! They caused us some confusion.</p>

<p>Take the road that goes to the left (not shown on the map), and
follow it. You will reach an obvious fork where a newer road goes
up to your right, ignore it and continue straight ahead on the now
grassy road (cairns and arrows mark it). It goes through an area of
new growth spruce following a clear cut, once out of that area
there is a trail going to the right, marked with heavy flagging.
Follow the trail to the summit of Mt. Redington.</p>

<p>The description may seem complicated, but if you follow the
directions you should never be in doubt as to where to go.</p>
